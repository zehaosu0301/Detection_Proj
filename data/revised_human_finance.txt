Ultimately, it is a personal decision and there is no reliable information to determine whether or not co-signing is a good move. The person considering co-signing will likely have more information about the borrower than anyone on this site, who can only offer their own individual experiences or preferences. They can determine whether the borrower is trustworthy and capable of paying off the loan without defaulting. While this site can offer general advice, it is important to remember that the decision to co-sign or not is entirely up to the person involved, based on their own personal facts and circumstances."}
{"2": "\n\nTo increase your credit score, pay off your credit card balance in full one day before the billing cycle closes. This will show that you have 100% available credit. For example, if your statement cycle ends on the 7th of each month, pay off your balance on the 6th instead of waiting until the due date, which is typically 2-3 weeks later. By consistently following this practice for three months, your credit score will improve because your debt ratio will be significantly lower. This ratio accounts for 30% of your credit score and can greatly impact it."}
{"3": "\n\nThis is my first encounter with a redemption programme, and I would appreciate information on my available options. One option is to keep the shares and receive 2.25 SEK per share after 31-May. The timing of the payout depends on how quickly the company and its bank process it. Alternatively, I can trade my shares during a specified window for the market price. How does this differ from receiving a dividend? I am not familiar with Swedish laws, but this structure may provide tax benefits. Additionally, it reduces the shareholders' capital in the company's books. Can I trade these redemption shares within the specified two weeks in May? Also, what is the point of trading them if they have a fixed price? Yes, trading is possible if I require funds sooner. However, the price is usually discounted by a few cents to cover interest for the remaining days."}

{"5": "\n\nThe main drawback of the interest-only loan is the higher interest rates. This is due to the increased risk to the bank as the principal amount remains outstanding for a longer period. According to the New York Times, these loans carry interest rates that are typically 0.125% to 0.5% higher than fully amortized jumbo loans. Additionally, they are more difficult to qualify for, and fewer lenders offer them due to the risk involved. While extra payments towards the principal are an option, these loans have limited downsides otherwise. The benefit of lower monthly payments is countered by the risks associated with not building equity in the home and the potential of the property's value sinking below the principal. If interest-only loans are your only way to afford payments, the home is likely too expensive for you. However, if you are using the funds for other purposes, such as reinvesting in a business or you have variable income, interest-only loans can provide flexibility and benefits. Commission-based salespeople or those in financial industries who receive bonuses can particularly benefit from these loans."}
{"6": "When applying for a car loan, the lender will pull your credit report and perform a \"hard inquiry\" which will be noted on your credit report and slightly count against you. However, this is a normal process but applying too many times too soon can have a negative impact. Lenders will also require proof of your income, such as recent pay stubs, to determine the maximum amount of credit they can lend you and at what interest rate. The better your credit profile, the more money they can lend and the lower the interest rate. \n\nIf you know the price of the car, determine how much you want to put down and take the difference to a bank or credit union, or work directly with the dealer who may offer special financing deals. During the purchasing process, the salesman will work the numbers to determine your monthly payment through their own bank. However, pay attention to this process as this is where they can gain leverage in the deal and make money through the interest rate. \n\nUltimately, the most important factor is that you can comfortably afford your monthly payment. Be conservative about it and budget your payments lower than what you think you can afford. Remember that car dealers may try to determine how much you can afford, but only you truly know your financial situation. Don't take more than you can handle to avoid financial burden."}

Please note that the check number is printed in two places on the front of each check - in the upper right corner and along the bottom edge. The bank scans the check number from the bottom edge, so covering or modifying the check number on the upper left corner will have no effect on the check number recorded during processing. Moreover, you cannot modify or cover the check numbers along the bottom of the check, as this can interfere with check processing. Modifying the check numbers is therefore not feasible. Your options are limited to either using the duplicate checks or not using them at all. However, the check numbers are only for your convenience and are not used in clearing the check. Although the numbers are recorded when the check is processed, duplicate numbers will not affect check clearing. The check number may only be important if you need to \"stop payment\" on a particular check, or if you inquire about a particular check. This should not be a problem since by the time you have used up the first batch of checks and start to use the checks with duplicate numbers, the first use of the early duplicate numbered checks will be sufficiently long ago so as not to cause any problems. The frequency with which you write checks, and the number of duplicate checks you have, should inform your decision. In my case, 100 checks can last me for years, so duplicates would not pose a problem."}

Shareholders who owned Apple stock on February 18, 2005, would receive an additional share for every outstanding share held on the record date, and trading would start on a split-adjusted basis on February 28, 2005. This announcement came a month after announcing earnings. In its first fiscal 2005 quarter ended December 25, 2004, the Company recorded a net profit of $295 million, or $.70 per diluted share, higher than its year-ago quarter's profit of $63 million or $.17 per diluted share. At 74%, the revenue for the quarter also surged, reaching $3.49 billion. Gross margin rose from 26.7% in the year-ago quarter to 28.5%. With an accent on stock price, companies like Google (GOOG), Netflix (NFLX), or even BRK-A/BRK-B don't offer stock splits. Though a split does not impact a company's intrinsic value, it may influence investors as to whether they perceive a stock to be \"cheap\" or \"expensive.\" As such, companies usually declare a stock split following the publication of their financial results for their previous fiscal year. Nonetheless, a split may still happen at any time when the board thinks that it can help their company."}

In that case, you can allocate the $18,000 employee contribution limit across both plans as you desire. Moreover, you can contribute profit-sharing of up to 20% of compensation in your solo 401(k) plan. Nonetheless, the profit-sharing limit encompasses all plans for your business. Hence, if you reach the maximum contribution limit in your solo 401(k), you cannot contribute to the SEP IRA. In other words, the solo 401(k) takes precedence over the SEP IRA in terms of contributions and operates under a shared profit-sharing contribution limit.

{"19": "\n\nOptions provide the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset, and can be allowed to expire if they do not have automatic expiry. If the option is out of the money at expiration, it is worthless, but otherwise has no negative consequences. The price of an option decreases as its time value decreases. Options have two values, exercise and time value, with far out of the money options primarily having time value while deep in the money options have both time and intrinsic value.\n\nThe option's time value stems from the possibility that the underlying asset's price could move in favor of the holder by the time it expires, potentially earning them more money. However, as expiration approaches, this possibility decreases, causing the time value to decrease, which could result in prices moving sharply after a long period without change.\n\nExchange traded options are more complex than OTC options because they require smaller trades to move the market. A single entity holding a large number of exchange traded options may sell them if they believe the price of the underlying asset will move significantly against them before expiration, thus lowering the market despite being in the money. If these are European style options, they have made a trade based on the belief that the asset's price will be below the strike price when they are exercised, limiting their potential loss.\n\nIf the preceding information does not accurately pertain to the specific option in question, more details may be necessary to offer a sound solution."}

However, to access all the details, one has to subscribe to the exchange's data feeds or open an account with a broker who provides this information - both of which come at a high cost.\n\nAnother crucial aspect to consider, besides depth, is frequency of updates. The BATS website seems to refresh every 5 seconds, which is not frequent enough to provide an accurate picture of the book.

It does not matter if your counterparty closes, opens or reopens their position in the same option as it does not affect your position. However, there are some differences between American and European options. European options expire on their due date, while American options can expire anytime before the due date if the holder decides to exercise them. If an American option holder exercises their option, a short option holder will be randomly assigned as the counterparty. Expiry takes place after the market closes. If a short American option expires early, the position will need to be reopened the following day. Additionally, the complexity slightly increases with dividends. It's crucial to note that terms like \"American\" and \"European\" do not refer to the location of the companies or the continents on which they are traded; they describe the expiry rules of the options."}

{"25": "\n\nI know a colleague who always chooses to lease his cars initially. Despite being financially well off with significant savings and owning a home, he prefers to treat the lease as an insurance policy for the car's first few years. If any issues arise during this time, such as damage or dissatisfaction, he can return the car to the dealer at the end of the term without any hassle and opt for the next one. However, I do acknowledge that some people may view leasing as a form of rental. If you are considering leasing a luxury vehicle or something outside of your budget, no amount of mental gymnastics can justify this as a wise decision.\n\nIt is also crucial to avoid putting down a payment for a lease. In the unfortunate event of the car being totaled early on, you will not recover the money you initially invested. It is essential to note that while leasing and purchasing may have identical numerical figures, the situation of each person differs. If the car is leased and then totaled, the bank can claim reimbursement from an insurer. If the payout amount is not enough to cover the car's value, GAP insurance will make up the difference. However, the excess remaining may not replace the entire down payment, requiring you to come up with the lost funds if you pursue another lease. Additionally, GAP insurance typically comes with a lease, whether you want it or not. In my opinion, if you decide to pursue a lease, there is no point in skimping on the value of GAP coverage."}

For example, if a $100K house was purchased with a 15% down payment, the PMI is 1.1% on the remaining $85,000 balance, not just the $5,000 difference to reach 80% LTV. This results in an additional annual payment of $935 on top of the mortgage cost. Even at 90% LTV, a shortfall of $10,000 would result in an annual PMI cost of $990.

It should be noted that while arbitrage opportunities are frequently available, they are often taken advantage of by market experts, and the law of one price does not apply to very short time frames. In the case of the Mexican market, price divergence has an average half-life of approximately three days. Some divergence may be expected due to ADR holders' limited knowledge of the foreign market.

{"32": "\n\nWhile I agree with your statement, I believe there are some nuances that should be considered. The conventional wisdom that all renters are resource-poor has influenced expert recommendations, but that does not mean that renters with greater resources should not consider purchasing additional insurance. For instance, when you decline an extended warranty offer for a $50 electronic item, it may be due to the relatively low cost of replacing the item in case of failure. However, if your net worth is substantial, losing $20K worth of possessions could be a significant financial blow, even if it represents only a small percentage of your overall net worth. In this sense, the value of your possessions may be a more significant portion of your net worth, making insurance a more rational choice. While your current level of coverage is suitable for your situation, if your possessions were worth $300K, your perspective on the matter would likely change. Therefore, it is important to consider the actual value of your possessions and weigh the cost-benefit of additional insurance based on that valuation."}
{"33": "\n\nTo avoid accruing interest on your credit card balance, it's important to carefully review your credit card agreement, especially the fine print. In the US, it's common for credit card companies to allow you to make charges during a certain time window. However, when your statement balance is calculated, you'll owe interest on any outstanding amount. For example, if you had a $0 balance on Jan 1st and you spent $1,000 on Jan 3rd, your next statement will be prepared around Jan 24th or Jan 27th. To avoid interest charges, make sure your balance is $0 when your statement is prepared. If your balance is $1,000 and you pay it off, but then charge $2,000, you'll start accruing interest on the new charges when your next statement is prepared. Some credit cards have a grace period before interest starts accruing, but it's important to check your card agreement to be sure. Remember, the best way to avoid interest charges is to read the fine print on your credit card agreement."}
{"34": "\n\nWe are facing a similar issue in Switzerland, and I have a background in institutional investment management and currency risk management. Home Bias is the core concept of your question, and there are many research papers available on this topic. The main problem with a high home bias is that the investment universe in your local market tends to be geared towards your country's largest corporations, resulting in a lack of diversification. In the case of the ASX, the top four companies are financials, making up almost 25% of the index, and I assume the bond market is similarly concentrated.\n\nThis lack of diversification and lower liquidity in smaller economies can have a negative impact on a portfolio. However, I appreciate your point about not taking a stance on FX as this makes finding a hedge ratio that minimizes portfolio volatility when investing internationally easier. For equities, a hedge ratio of 0-30% is usually effective, and for bonds, a ratio of 80-100% is usually required as currency risk contributes more to overall volatility in bond portfolios.\n\nInterestingly, we have found that if you hedge the AUD, you may actually increase total portfolio risk, which may be due to the AUD's use in carry trades. It's important to be careful when buying currency-hedged share classes of investment funds and to read closely how the share class implements its currency hedging strategy."}
{"35": "\n\nAs a resident of the Netherlands, an EU country, I have some concerns about using credit cards. Firstly, they are more vulnerable to misuse as anyone who finds the card can use it for online purchases without needing a PIN. Additionally, the information on the card can be stored in vulnerable databases that can be hacked by cybercriminals. On the other hand, debit cards have a more secure process of requiring a PIN when making online payments, as is the case with the cards I have in the Netherlands. Also, if the user has authorized periodic payments on a website, this information is available at the bank which enables them to monitor transactions more efficiently.\n\nAnother disadvantage of credit cards is that banks receive a percentage from each payment, which in the long run, consumers have to bear. Debit cards, on the other hand, have a fixed fee per transaction. With automatic monthly payments, unexpected deductions may occur, whereas debit cards allow users to keep an eye on their balance and avoid future issues.\n\nHowever, credit cards have some benefits. For example, they offer an insurance policy, which allows users to recoup losses associated with fraudulent charges. Furthermore, credit cards can be more readily used for international online purchases as some US websites only accept cards with specific number/expiry date/security codes.\n\nIn summary, I believe it's important to have a credit card, but only use it when necessary, and keep a watchful eye on payments and transactions."}

The type of material used is crucial - for most casual clothes, 100% cotton or jersey are both great quality options.

Seek out similar materials when shopping, regardless of the store, as even expensive retailers may carry subpar clothing items.\n\nAnother important factor to consider is the stitching quality. Check the top and bottom stitches, as well as the sides and armholes underneath the garment. Look for consistent and tidy stitching patterns to ensure the item will withstand repeated wear.\n\nWhile personal style can vary greatly, stores often cater to specific age groups or aesthetics. If you find a store that fits your personal style and offers high-quality clothing at reasonable prices, it's worth considering it as a go-to shopping destination.

{"42": "\n\nRevised: While it may seem useful, knowing the answer to whether a stock is undervalued or not is often not helpful. This is because a stock's current price is based on the collective analysis of several factors such as dividend rate, industry, growth prospects, volatility, risk, etc., that determine its intrinsic value. Hence, attempting to research a stock's value involves figuring out if the market has misjudged or overlooked something that is relevant to its cash flows in the future. However, most factors that affect the stock's price are already well-known to the market, making it unlikely to identify mispricings. Additionally, unless you are an expert in the field, guessing whether a stock is mispriced or not is essentially gambling. Even experienced finance professionals tend to invest in a diversified portfolio with low transactions costs to build wealth in the long run, rather than trying to outperform the market by finding undervalued stocks.

{"45": "\n\nIt is highly recommended that you seek the assistance of a certified tax professional to accurately address your tax concerns and provide guidance on how to proceed. Attempting to handle the matter on your own may not be feasible, as you are already in a state of non-compliance with the IRS. It is possible that a professional could advise on how to mitigate the penalties and potentially negotiate a waiver, depending on the circumstances of your case. It is important to be wary of unfounded claims that suggest you do not need to pay anything, as based on the information provided, it appears you may indeed owe taxes and be in trouble with the IRS. It is possible that there may have been a misunderstanding in the past regarding filing taxes for your business. A licensed CPA or EA can assist in clarifying and addressing these issues, as well as provide education on how to avoid similar problems in the future."}
{"46": "\n\nI agree with Dillip Sarwate's points, but I would like to add a few more thoughts. It's important to note that the method you use to make payments - whether it's through a biller's website, your bank's website, by mail, or in person - is not as important as making the payment on time. If there's a chance that waiting until the due date to pay could result in a missed payment, it's not worth the risk. Late payment charges can be much higher than the interest you would earn on your savings. Keep in mind that we're talking about small amounts here. If your monthly bills add up to, say, $3,000 and you're earning 3.6% on your savings, paying a bill just two weeks late would only earn you an additional $4 per month. On the other hand, if you miss a payment and get hit with a late fee - like the $35 I paid on my credit card - it would negate any savings you might have earned. That's why I prefer to schedule all my payments in advance, often for a week before the due date, using either my bank's website or the biller's website. This gives me plenty of time to make sure the payment is processed on time."}
{"47": "\n\nThe breakeven point does not occur in 8 years as previously stated. Instead, you determined the number of years it would take to break even by paying $500 per year versus paying $4000 per year for one year. The calculation came out to 80 years ($500 x 8 = $4000; 80 years x $500 = $40000). It is clear that paying $500 per year would take you 80 years to spend the same total amount ($40000) as you would in 10 years of paying $4000 per year. It is obvious which choice is better at this point. \n\nAfter 10 years, consider the scenarios: In option #1, you would have spent $5000 ($500 x 10) and would need to continue spending $500 per year indefinitely. In option #2, you would have spent $40000 ($4000 x 10) but would have no more payment obligations. However, in option #2, you would currently have $35000 ($40000 - $5000) less money than you would in option #1. If you stayed with option #1, you could invest that $35000 at a conservative 1.43% annual return and still cover the $500 payments indefinitely without reducing your remaining $35000. It is likely that, over time, your investment will earn more than 1.43% per year, resulting in a significant advantage."}
{"48": "\n\nTo ensure that your tax returns (both personal and business) are filed accurately, follow these steps: gather all necessary paperwork, solicit recommendations from your personal network for a reputable CPA, and pay for their services. Once your tax return is complete, have the CPA walk you through each item you do not understand. Repeat this process until you feel confident enough to file on your own. It is still wise to have them review your work for a few times afterward. Additionally, finding a CPA with reasonable fees is beneficial since they can point out tax inefficiencies in your business, covering the cost of their services. This practice is admirable for CPAs to ensure their clients get the value they deserve, though it may not apply to all professionals in the field. Keep this as your criteria when looking for a recommended CPA."}
{"49": "\n\n\"I suggest splitting the savings into two parts. It's important to have at least 50% in readily available cash or MMA/Checking as an emergency fund. For the remaining savings, consider investing in CDs with a maturity of 30 to 180 days, depending on your financial situation. Keep in mind that your desire for the car may have diminished by the time you save up enough money. Thus, it's worth reconsidering your current job and income stream to increase savings towards what you do want. Also, be prepared for any unexpected expenses. For example, my landlord sold the house I was renting while I was on a month-to-month contract. I had to pay a second deposit and move expenses, but luckily, I had followed my tax attorney's advice to create a cushion of liquid assets that could cover three months of all expenses. While I'm not religious, I've heard that Mormons advise keeping a year's worth of supplies at home for emergencies. Ultimately, it's important to remember that everyone's situation is different, and this advice may not apply to everyone.\""}
{"50": "\n\nWhile it is possible to trade large volumes in highly liquid securities, it may take several days to execute a single contract at that amount. Additionally, regulatory bodies like the OCC implement position size limits to prevent individuals from cornering the market through options trading. It is still possible, however, to exercise contracts and suddenly accumulate a significant stake in the asset. For instance, position size limits would restrict an individual to opening 100 million contracts at the specified cost of $1 per contract. To spread out orders, traders can choose from various expiration dates and strike prices across different options. Some highly liquid examples include trading options contracts on S&P 500 index products like the SPY ETF or S&P 500 futures.

A template sheet is copied and modified for the current month, which saves us time because 90% of the information is the same. This is why I find EveryDollar challenging as I have to enter everything each month. We also have separate checking accounts and take different expenses' responsibility, which risks acting as roommates. Still, we both understand that the money in one person's account belongs to the other and have to make up for shortfalls on the other's part. We use cash for everyday purchases, which means we don't need to track expenses or enter transactions. This system works for us, and managing our finances takes very little time. Our budget meeting usually takes less than 30 minutes, including goal tracking. We follow the 80/20 principle and don't see value in tracking every penny.

{"53": "\n\nThe W4 form sets the amount of income tax withholding, but it does not affect FICA taxes. Withholding ensures that you do not have to make estimated tax payments. Failure to pay sufficient quarterly estimates or withholding enough could result in penalties for underpayment, but no other consequences. These penalties will be calculated when you file your tax return. If you discover that you need additional withholding, you can use the extra withholding line on the W4. Withholding is advantageous because it is back-loaded, and the IRS does not object. The company is not responsible for your taxes, and you should notify them if your personal circumstances change. You are solely responsible for the tax bill, as there is no company-paid portion of your income tax. The company only pays an employer share of FICA that is not influenced by the W4. Determine how much you owe the IRS and whether you can pay it or need to explore an installment program. In any case, be sure to file your tax return on time."}
{"54": "\n\nCurrencies that are pegged or fixed require the central issuer to hold a proportional amount of foreign currencies. To understand this, imagine a portfolio of currencies from which the central bank issues shares in the form of its own currency. However, if the central bank says these \"shares\" are worth $1, but the underlying components of the portfolio are worth only $0.80 and decreasing, it becomes expensive for the central bank to maintain its peg. Eventually, people will question the central bank's solvency as they realize the $1 they hold is not worth what the central bank claims it to be due to changes in prices of goods and services, especially imports. In such cases, even shadow economies tend to trade using a currency that reflects labor. The Swiss National Bank faced a similar issue in early 2015, as it struggled with the volatility of the Euro to which it had previously pegged its currency.\n\nThe central bank can devalue its currency by adjusting the proportions of its reserve, such as selling foreign currency X and buying more currency Y. However, this may result in losses for the central bank (as seen with the Swiss National Bank). Another option is to flood the economy with more currency, diluting the value of each individual 1 dollar equivalent. This can be done by issuing bonds or monetizing goods and services from the private sector in exchange for bonds. Although people call this \"printing money,\" it is a misnomer since printers are not a relevant tool in this day and age. Once the bond is on the central bank's balance book, the entity that provided the service now has a bond that can be immediately sold for cash. The bond did not previously exist, but the central bank created it, and it can infinitely exchange goods and services for bonds. This is known as bond monetization or quantitative easing, practiced by central banks such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, and now the Central Bank of the Republic of China."}

{"56": "\n\nIs it really that bad? Well, it depends on how bad \"bad\" is. When a government has a large debt, it can create problems similar to those that arise when an individual has a large debt. The major issue arises when an increasing amount of your income goes towards paying off the interest on the debt, which consequently isn't available to spend on goods and services. If things get bad enough, you may find yourself unable to make payments, default on loans, and resort to making serious sacrifices such as selling your property to pay the debt.\n\nOne advantage that nations have over individuals is that they can sometimes repudiate debt by declaring that they are not going to pay. However, lenders can refuse to give them more money, which doesn't solve the problem of the original loans not being paid back. In theory, other nations could send troops to seize property to pay off the loan, but this is an extreme solution since modern warfare is very expensive, and the cost of the war is likely to be more than what you'd recover from the debt. \n\nIt's challenging to give a specific number for how much debt is too much, just as we cannot give a \"maximum acceptable debt\" for an individual. However, American banks usually have a rule of thumb whereby they won't loan you a large amount of money if your total debt payments would be more than 1/3 of your income. Although this amount may seem high to some people, young individuals just starting out and living in a high housing cost area may find this payment painful but still acceptable."}
{"57": "\n\nIf you have incurred a business expense, you may be eligible for reimbursement. Reimbursement refers to money paid back to you by your employer, which is not typically considered as income since it is meant to cover expenses you paid for using your own after-tax money. However, some requirements must be met for reimbursement to be considered legitimate from an income tax standpoint. While I am not familiar with the specific income tax laws in the UK, the requirements for reimbursement are generally similar elsewhere. Typically, to receive reimbursement, you must prove that the expense was valid and for the employer's benefit, and that it was requested by the employer. You must also submit a receipt and follow the employer's procedures for approval. If you incurred a \u00a31500 expense, the income tax agent may ask for an explanation of the business activity that caused it. If they are not satisfied, the \u00a3750 you received may be considered income. Failure to follow proper reimbursement procedures may also result in the \u00a3750 being declared as income, regardless of the business need. It is important that you verify these requirements with your employer's tax accountant."}

If your debts exceed $4k, start by paying off the Best Buy card with the highest interest rate, then work your way down to the smaller balances. One tweak I would suggest is avoiding making any payments toward your Citi balance, as this only reduces the amount owed but not the total number of creditors taking money from your account."}
{"61": "This text presents a plethora of research studies indicating that actively-managed funds tend to underperform market indexes and passively-managed funds due to high turnover rates and relatively high fees. While the issue of survivorship bias presents some challenges to this research, several academic papers have addressed this concern and provide further insight into the debate. The seminal paper by Michael Jensen in 1968 defined Jensen's alpha, a widely-used measure of mutual fund performance, and found that managers who actively picked stocks performed worse than random chance. Another paper by Martin Gruber in 1996 found that active management adds value, but mutual funds charge more than the value added, and Mark Carhart's 1997 paper concluded that trading and expense ratios negatively impact mutual fund performance. However, Russ Wermer's 2000 study found that actively-managed mutual funds hold stocks that outperform the market, though the net return of the funds underperforms passive funds and the market itself. Lastly, a 2008 paper by Fama and French concluded that active investment is a negative sum game after costs, suggesting that expense ratios and other fees minimize the returns to active investment. One highly-regarded commercial dataset for researching mutual fund performance is the CRSP Survivor-Bias-Free US Mutual Fund Database from the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago."}
{"62": "\n\nIt has been years since I lived in Seattle, but I remember it being quite expensive. Housing costs are disproportionately high in comparison to expected salaries. For someone coming from Puerto Rico, the cost of living may be shocking, as well as the lack of sunshine. However, the answer to your question is subjective, as one person may require a budget of 100K to cover expenses while another may need less than 30K. The location you choose to live in Seattle will also affect your housing costs, as prices vary throughout the area. One advantage of the region is the affordability of vacations, with fishing, hiking, and cycling being popular and relatively inexpensive activities. It is important to consider your retirement plans as well, as retiring in Puerto Rico will require much less money than retiring in Seattle. For instance, Marysville is a safe and desirable location, but it is far from Seattle, making commuting difficult. A 1200 sq ft home in Marysville costs around 200K, which is significantly higher than the cost for the same home in Orlando, where you\u2019ll also enjoy more sunshine."}

{"65": "\n\nTo summarize, if you are starting with a sum of $300K, you have two possible paths. The first option is to forgo starting a small business and instead get a job. In this case, you can invest the entire amount into safe liquid investments and gradually move the maximum amount each year into your retirement accounts. Depending on your employer, you may have access to options like 401K, deductible IRA, and Roth IRA, which all dictate how much money you can transfer into your accounts. It's important to invest from your paycheck and pull an equal amount from the remaining $300K for a 401K. If you're married, the same procedure can be used for your spouse. You can use your current income to fund vacations or splurges since you won't need to put additional funds into the retirement plan. By your late 30s, your entire $300K will be invested in your retirement account, but you won't be able to touch it without paying penalties until you're closer to age 60. Therefore, before semi-retirement, you will need to invest some of your salary into non-retirement accounts to cushion yourself between 40 and 60.\n\nThe second option is to invest in starting a small business by taking a chunk of the $300K and deciding when to use it in X years. This invested money must be kept liquid and safely invested so that it can be used when necessary without loss. The remaining funds can be invested as described in the first option. You will need to invest and convert funds to retirement funds earlier in this case. However, the income generated by your small business may be able to fund your semi-retirement as well.\n\nIt's important to note some rules, such as the Roth IRA rule of remaining invested for 5 years to avoid penalties and the fact that stocks may be too volatile for short-term investment. You should also consider hiring a financial adviser to get a complete plan for a fixed fee. They can advise on investment options, explain tax implications, and discuss how your investment impacts your semi-retirement plans. Be sure to review your plan every few years as tax laws change."}
{"66": "\n\nIt is highly likely that the statement is referring to trading or speculating with leverage, rather than investing. Once leverage is added to the equation, the statement makes perfect sense. For instance, during the period of 2007-2009, purchasing the $SPX at its highest point of $1560.00 and then experiencing its low point of $683.00 would have resulted in a margin call for a $1560.00 account with only 2:1 leverage. In Europe, various leveraged products are available, such as index CFDs, and trading with leverage greater than 50:1 can quickly lead to a margin call or the broker closing the position. While investing always carries some level of risk, currency is a position, and it is doubtful that more than 90% of investors lose money or purchasing power when it comes to stocks. However, speculators who use leverage or try to trade based on swings or news have an extremely high risk of losing money or purchasing power."}

You could also do this independently by finding a reliable broker with affordable transaction fees, opening an account, and purchasing stocks using the broker's platform."}
{"68": "\n\nIt is possible to obtain credit as long as there are no price controls or quotas in place. In the housing sector of the United States, there is a strong demand for credit resulting in little price regulation, particularly in interest rates. However, corporate banks are now liable to the borrowers and investors if there is default and require banks to buy back loans if they fail. Consequently, banks are now only financing the most creditworthy. Despite this, markets always find a way to flow. While it may be expensive, you can obtain a fully-financed mortgage if you are willing to pay interest rates that are double what you would normally get with good credit. If the foreclosure process in your state is quick and benefits the lender, your interest rate may be lower. You can find individual creditors from mortgage investment clubs and religious institutions who offer surprisingly low-interest rates. Moreover, since the cost of your prospective home is so low, an investor flush with cash might take a chance on you with an investment of just $50,000.

{"72": "\n\nRevised: As long as the funds come from legal sources (excluding money laundering), I believe you can deposit them into a UK bank account without issue. You will only need to pay taxes on the interest earned on the funds once they are in the UK account. It is likely that taxes have already been paid on the funds when they were earned in Greece. While banks may not inquire too closely about the source of the funds upon deposit, they may ask more questions if you try to borrow money from them. I had a similar experience when opening a bank account in the US without an SSN; however, I did have to pay taxes on the interest earned in that account. If you deposited a large sum of money, you may be asked about the source of the funds, but as long as they were earned legally, there should not be any issues to worry about. However, I am concerned about the risk of default, as has occurred in the past in countries like Argentina and the US during the Great Depression when governments prevented people from withdrawing their funds from banks. While this may not be an issue if the funds are in Euros, it is still a concerning possibility. It does not seem fair that Greeks might be prevented from accessing their Euros while Italians are not."}

What steps can we take to prevent this company from attempting to take funds from our account via ACH in the future? Is creating a new account with a different account number and closing the existing one a viable option? Yes, that's a good temporary solution. However, leaving the account with a zero balance might result in fees due to insufficient funds whenever the other company tries to charge us again. It's best to avoid this option. Instead, we should provide our bank with a service termination notice to demonstrate that we're no longer engaged with the other company, and have them effectively block them from withdrawing funds. However, a termination notice with only our signature may not be sufficient as ACH withdrawals are generally considered equivalent to checks. Unless we put a stop payment in place and claim fraud, we'll likely end up having to set up a new account again while the other company tries to recover their funds. This is one reason why I'm hesitant to allow standing ACH authorizations. The American banking system is geared against consumers and lags behind other more advanced countries where standing withdrawal authorizations can be revoked directly by the bank."}

The total number of shares owned in the current quarter is the sum of the shares owned in the previous quarter plus the quarterly dividend, divided by the new share price. \n\nFor example, let's assume that the starting point is right after Quarter One: \n\n- The new share price is $20 * 1.0125 = $20.25 \n- 1000 shares at $20.25 each yield a quarterly dividend of $20.25 * 0.01 * 1000 = $202.5 \n- The number of new shares is calculated as $202.5 divided by $20.25, which equals 10 \n\nFollowing this formula over several cycles, we have the following results: \n\nAfter 8 quarters (2 years): 1061.52 shares at $21.548 per share \n\nAfter 20 quarters (5 years): 1196.15 shares at $25.012 per share \n\nAfter 40 quarters (10 years): 1459.53 shares at $32.066 per share \n\nGraphically, this looks like the provided image. It's important to note that while the calculations are mathematically accurate, a 5% growth rate and 4% dividend rate are optimistic assumptions."}

However, in the unlikely event of oil supplies being oversupplied to the extent of reaching an 82-year high in the US or an all-time record in EIA weekly inventories, the cost of oil sands would cap the oil price. This scenario is concerning, particularly if there are no developments in refinery laws or technology.

{"87": "\n\nIt has been pointed out that HFT does not involve mineral mining or the creation of iPods. However, it should be noted that HFT is essentially a computerized approach to human trading. The trading is still being carried out on behalf of human account owners, albeit through automatic algorithmic trades. In exchange markets, fast execution of trades is highly desirable. For instance, if there are two exchanges, one that operates once a month and another that operates once a week, the latter would be preferred. This is because investors want to sell or buy their stocks as quickly as possible. This applies even to very short time periods in seconds or fractions of seconds. \n\nOne criticism of HFT is that there are instances where the market goes against the algorithm, leading to a large change in prices in a matter of minutes or even seconds. Although such trades are often cancelled by exchanges, this practice only encourages more aggressive HFT trading, as HFT traders can have their losses cancelled out. This is not possible for LFTs (low frequency traders). The following is a list of some of the trades that have been cancelled: \n\n8/26/2010: Nasdaq cancels trades of CORE stock \n10/4/2010: Nasdaq cancels trades of CENX stock \n10/15/2010: NYSE cancels trades of PAY stock \n10/18/2010: NYSE cancels $500 million worth of SPY trades \n5/18/2011: NYSE cancels 15,900 trades of BEE.PR.C \n6/21/2011: Nasdaq cancels CNTY trades \n12/2/2011: London Metals Exchange cancels trades of copper."}

When making a cash purchase, there is no record of the transaction, and counting out large sums of money can lead to errors and delays. Additionally, paying with cash may raise suspicion of illegal activity, although the likelihood of scrutiny from the IRS is lower when there is no paper trail.

{"90": "\n\nRevised:\n\n\"Book value\" refers to the value of a company if all assets are sold and the company is liquidated. \"Price\" is the value at which its shares are bought or sold by investors. If the price-to-book value ratio is less than one, it means the company is being traded at a lower value than its actual theoretical price. For example, if a $100 book value company is being traded at $99 or below, it is considered cheaper than its real value.\n\nHowever, there are cases where a company's valuation is based on factors such as production and orders, while the value of expensive real estate on which the plant is built is not taken into account by investors. Alternatively, a construction company may have a large inventory of real estate but may not have enough cash flow to sustain monthly expenses, which could lead the company to sell its real estate at a discount just to survive. In such cases, market investors may bring the price below the company's book value, indicating trouble and potential risk."}

If you prefer a highly secure investment, your best option would be banks, even though interest rates may remain low for a while. However, if you're willing to take on a bit more risk, you could try investing in some index-tracking ETFs from providers such as Vanguard, Street State, and Betashares in Australia. To gain an overview of the Australian ETF market, StockSpot is a useful tool. By investing in an index of the market, such as S&P 200, through index funds, your potential risk level is reduced, though your potential returns may be limited. The market may still undergo significant fluctuations, which is riskier compared to keeping your money in an Australian bank. To begin, consider the free trade deals that HSBC, Nabtrade, Commsec, and Westpac have to offer, up to a specific value. It's recommended to switch to other free trading brokers or cheaper alternatives like CMC Markets once the free trade periods have ended."}

For instance, if the distance from your home to your employer (location A) is 20 miles, and the distance from your home to the contracted business (location B) is 30 miles, you can only claim 10 miles each way, totaling 20 miles. But, if location B is closer to your home than your employer's location, you cannot claim this deduction. To take this deduction, you must itemize by filling out a Schedule A for itemized deductions and Form 2106 to determine the amount of the deduction for travel expenses.

However, you lack the funds and decide to borrow the money from a bank at a 10% interest rate. At the year's end, this project returns $400,000. This example exemplifies \"good\" debt, where you borrow for something that creates value. Ideally, people should approach all purchases, even those made with cash, as investments in themselves.

If the share's price (or underlying asset) decreases to 70, the holder of the put will likely exercise their right to sell a share worth 70 at the strike price of 80. As the put option writer, you have an obligation to buy the share at the strike price of 80, even if it's currently trading at 70. It's important to always consider the holder's perspective because if they do exercise the option, the writer could experience a loss. The maximum loss for the writer is the breakeven FSP, which is calculated by subtracting the premium paid from the strike price. However, if the holder chooses not to exercise the option, you as the writer can make a profit, which is capped at the maximum put premium received."}

In analyzing the prices, you may choose to use either method or consider the midpoint between the two prices.

In this sense, gold is used to purchase goods and services, and its value is assigned during the process of an exchange. This value is subjective and varies from person to person. On the other hand, gold is valued as an end in itself; this happens when someone values gold for its intrinsic properties, such as its rarity, colour, and durability. However, few people view gold in this manner because it is not widely used in this way. Even those who value gold for its own sake often do so because it provides a function, such as being used to create jewellery. If this function were to disappear, the value of gold would likely decrease. Overall, gold has perceived value for most people, but innate value only for a select few."}
{"104": "\n\nThere are several reasons why companies choose to offer stocks to their employees, and these reasons may vary depending on the company's location. Firstly, by granting stocks to employees, it shows that they are invested in the company's success. This incentivizes employees to work harder to increase the value of their shares. Sometimes, there is a vestment period that requires employees to hold onto the stocks for a certain amount of time before they can sell them and they must also keep working at the company for a specific period.\n\nSecondly, providing stocks instead of cash doesn't affect the company's liquid cash. Though it is still an expense and could potentially devalue shares of other shareholders, it won't hinder the working capital that is necessary to maintain business activities.\n\nLastly, from an employee's perspective, receiving stocks could have tax benefits, particularly for substantial amounts. Depending on the jurisdiction, receiving shares could result in lower tax rates than receiving a cash equivalent sum. This is because the employee can draw out the money over time, reducing their tax obligation each year. There may be other methods available based on the jurisdiction that aren't applicable now.\n\nWe hope this information is helpful to you."}

In reality, it's challenging to pay more for a stock than its current listing and sell it again for enough to cover the difference, especially when factoring in commissions. Option transactions are essentially a bet, and unless you are confident in your predictive powers, you are likely to be the long-term loser. However, selling puts can offer win-win scenarios, where you are betting one direction but would be content with the alternative outcome. For instance, selling a $28 put on a stock you estimate to be worth that much ensures you either pocket a few bucks or receive 100 shares at the price you were willing to pay. While there is still room for error in your estimate, options are not unique in that regard, and bad estimations are a risk with any investment strategy."}

If they can't, the leaving party may struggle to secure financing for a new home. While I prefer the option of renting separately, I understand that you may be better positioned to own than your partner, who may have a stronger emotional need to own.

The annual fee for wealth management typically ranges from close to zero to 0.75% depending on the strategy and services offered. Investing in the S&P500 on behalf of an investor shouldn't require a fee, but more complex strategies with independent returns from market movement, like a smart beta or alpha strategy, will involve a fee.

{"129": "\n\nI enjoy providing responses that may not offer a clear cut solution. The decision to sell a car depends on various factors. If driving an older car embarrasses you or your significant other dislikes it, while also not maintaining the vehicle well and experiencing numerous issues, then the value of the car will likely decrease below the blue book value, and it may be best to sell it. However, if you are unconcerned about the car's appearance, it runs smoothly with minimal repairs, you maintain it yourself, and have a supportive network of friends willing to help if needed, then the car's worth to you may never go below the official blue book value. Therefore, you can drive the car until it's no longer feasible. The blue book value is the average value of a car's age and exterior condition, and the difference between its worth to other individuals and yourself determines the decision to sell. For instance, there are some people who do not mind buying cheap used cars and use them until they eventually fall apart. As they earned more, it became too time-consuming to perform their repairs, and their perception of old cars' value declined, leading them to purchase newer models. This is why it's challenging to provide a straightforward answer."}

In order to stimulate more transactions and increase merchant fees, these companies offer rewards to their users. For small businesses, it's essential to strike a balance between the cost of credit card transactions and the convenience they provide to customers. To combat the higher cost of processing small credit card transactions - which, at 2% or 50 cents (whichever is greater), can be quite expensive - some small businesses may choose to establish a minimum transaction amount. While businesses do factor in the cost of credit card usage into their prices, they can still gain a little extra profit if some customers opt to pay in cash."}

For a more exhaustive discussion of the legal implications, you may want to pose a similar query on Law.SE. However, I will limit my response to the personal finance aspect of the issue. Essentially, you cannot bank on current tax laws remaining in place in the future, so it is prudent to maintain some flexibility in your investment and retirement strategies. For instance, consider having both Roth and traditional 401(k) accounts. It is not advisable to have millions of dollars in Roth accounts as any retroactive changes to tax laws will likely target higher balances. In assessing tax deductions, it is better to prioritize deductions that apply at present over those that apply in the future. Lastly, if you run into trouble due to a retroactive shift, it is important to consult a tax attorney specializing in handling IRS-related issues in order to negotiate a potential settlement for less than the full tax bill resulting from such changes."}
{"134": "\n\nOver the summer, I took out a loan from my 401(k) to put towards the down payment on a new house. As we planned to sell our condo within a few months, we only required the loan for a short time and aimed to keep monthly payments low since we would be paying for two mortgages. I believed the market might decline in the future, so I wanted to capitalize on the chance to sell high and buy back low (however, this did not occur). In July 2017, I withdrew $17,000 from my account, consisting of $16,850 principal and a $150 processing fee. The loan carried an effective APR of 4.19%, with payments of $86.00 every month over 10 years totaling a finance charge of $3,790 paid back into my account. I was satisfied with the terms, as it temporarily secured my finances until the condo was sold. However, I was forced to pay back the loan roughly 20 weeks later following a change in employment. This occurred using the proceeds from the condo's sale. By then, the market had improved, causing the net difference in shares I now owned, including the bought shares from interest payments, to fall short of the original count by $538.25 in today's value. Together with the $150 fee, the overall cost of the 20-week loan was roughly 4.05%, due to the withdrawn principal's loss in value. On paper, my account balance would have been more if I had not withdrawn the money. If you estimate the current market return into 52 weeks, this translates to the loan having an APR cost of roughly 10.5%, although this is not useful for a multi-year calculation, it seems accurate for a 12-month projection. The genuine cost of the loan relies greatly on the market's performance, and if you can pay it back, it's worth doing so, as you may be mandated to do so at any time if your employment ends or you switch jobs. Maintaining substantial liquid resources to try and anticipate a dip in the market is not practical since funding the loan took six days and another week to clarify queries. Repaying the loan took ten days from the initial paperwork to check cashing and repurchasing shares."}

Unfortunately, the application of these taxes varies from city to city, making it difficult to determine whether they apply in your situation. You will need to research your local laws, which can be easy to access if your town maintains a comprehensive website about local laws. However, if not, you may need to conduct more in-depth research. Regardless, it's important to investigate potential taxes since noncompliance may result in penalties. Due to AirBnB's growing popularity, many municipalities have cracked down on renters who evade taxes, and who may not comply with other zoning laws applicable to neighborhood residential areas if running a business from their rental property."}

{"141": "\n\nThe main challenge associated with owning individual stocks is their susceptibility to price fluctuations, also known as risk. Your described scenarios assume that the stock will behave exactly as anticipated, such as the price or portfolio doubling, yet it is essential to take risk into account. The Sharpe Ratio and Sortino Ratio are two methods for measuring risk in a stock or portfolio. Diversification is frequently advised to individual investors as a way to decrease risk; however, this is only part of the story. You can construct a portfolio that minimizes risk when you can identify stocks that are not priced correlated. This method results in the avoidance of a 10 percent tax on stock grants, yet it requires the acceptance of considerable risk to avoid the differential 10 percent tax. Investing in a lower-risk ETF rather than an individual stock is an alternative to investing in a single stock. Additionally, you can chart the growth and price of an ETF, such as SPY, against your stock to observe the difference in both growth and fluctuation. You can compare the volatility, or beta, of your stock to SPY, like IBM, and assess your willingness to accept that risk. By identifying stocks that have opposite movements and creating a beta-balanced portfolio, the variability can be reduced, thereby lowering the risk, albeit at the cost of a potential decrease in the overall return. Single stocks are not suitable for this, but one can balance the risk for this stock grant by using the rest of the portfolio if there is more money to invest. For instance, some years ago, I accumulated more than 10,000 shares in a company, where I worked. During my tenure, their stock price fluctuated between $30/share and less than $1/share. I was able to sell at $3/share."}

This practice originated from the days when most stock trading was conducted by human traders, and computers had limited involvement. Paper tickets were used for trading, and the settlement period was five days, making the currently accepted three-day period an improvement. Settlement periods were necessary to allow traders to finalize their transactions and ensure that every settlement was completed accurately. However, smaller trading firms without technology had longer settlement periods, prolonging the process. Today, technology makes settlements easy, and they typically occur at the end of each trading day. Trading firms calculate their trades, determine who they owe, and send lump sum payments to their counterparts. The 3-day period may now be used for trade verification.

{"150": "\n\nRevised: While I may not be fully informed, my understanding is that leasing is primarily aimed at managing cash-flow in a business. It involves a consistent monthly payment rather than a lump sum payment upfront. My German accountant has recommended that I pay in cash, take out a loan (often with good rates offered by manufacturers), or opt for leasing in that order of preference. As the leasing company must source the necessary funds for the transaction, they are unlikely to operate at a loss. Additionally, they likely possess a greater understanding of resale values and can factor these into their calculations when determining the most beneficial deal. I don't see any particular advantage in leasing an electric car over another type of vehicle. Ultimately, I am leaning towards purchasing a vehicle using a loan provided by the manufacturer, as this option often includes favorable insurance deals.

If the appreciation is realized, meaning the asset has been sold for liquidity, Derek_6424246's suggestion is appropriate. On the other hand, if the gains are unrealized, meaning the underlying asset(s) have only increased or decreased in value, it may be wise to record it under an Income:Unrealized Gains account. The main distinction between the two lies in taxable events; realized gains are taxable, whereas unrealized gains are not. For instance, when tracking retirement account values, it is often useful to exclude interest, dividends, and contributions from the calculation and instead label the increase in value as income from an Income:Unrealized Gains account. This provides an accurate assessment of net worth, but the money is non-liquid and non-taxable. There is no need to create an additional Expense account to track losses. Think of the Unrealized Gains account as an income account that can fluctuate up and down (and potentially even become negative) over time."}
{"160": "\n\nIn Maryland, landlords must hold tenants' security deposits in an escrow account and return them with interest. The interest paid is simple and not compounded, and the rate has changed over the years. Prior to October 1, 2004, the rate was 4%, before going down to 3% until January 1, 2015. The current rate is 1.5%, or the simple interest rate accrued at the daily U.S. Treasury yield curve rate for one year, as of the first business day of each year, whichever is higher (this year's rate is 1.5%). \n\nTo make calculating this interest easier, Maryland's Department of Housing and Community Development offers a Security Deposit Calculator. However, it's important to note that it only works for deposits made since January 1, 2015. It's also unclear whether the interest rate in effect when the security deposit was made is the same over the years. \n\nIf the interest rate remains at 4%, the maximum interest a tenant could receive after 43 years is $429.76, which is $158 plus ($158 x 4% x 43). Since interest is accrued every six months, tenants won't receive interest for the three months they rented in their 44th year. However, under the new law, starting this year, interest will be accrued monthly. \n\nIf the interest rate fluctuates with new laws, tenants can expect to receive at least $413.18 for their security deposit, which is $158 plus ($158 x 4% x 32.5) plus ($158 x 3% x 10.25) plus ($158 x 1.5% x 0.5). \n\nIt's also worth noting that while the Security Deposit Calculator works for most of Maryland, the laws in Prince George's County may differ.

Furthermore, a credit rating is not a measure of the \"risk of doing business,\" but rather an evaluation of an individual or company's ability to repay its obligations. Therefore, the credit rating of a government does not necessarily impact the credit rating of companies in that country.

However, if your assessment of price movement is incorrect, you can lose money. If you went long, you may sell for a lower rate than what you paid, or if you sold short, you may have to buy back at a higher price than you initially sold for.

Housing market fluctuations could significantly impact your property's value, so this is something to keep in mind. If you're in doubt about the market value, reaching out to a local property management company for advice might be helpful. In terms of costs, you may have to pay for these services, with an appraisal costing around $500 based on my experience. Plan for travel expenses if you need to be on-site during evaluations. Finally, note that where I'm from, there is a law protecting homestead rights, meaning your ex may still have a claim to the property.

{"174": "\n\nInitially, I was concerned that discussing ways to \"help the economy\" might be too broad, given the countless actions one can take with their money. Still, I believe it is possible to cover some general concepts without listing every detail. Regular investing provides companies with capital from selling stocks, which can help the economy through expansion and other activities. However, some may use this money for executive bonuses instead. On the other hand, spending money carelessly is usually unhelpful unless we are in a recession. Instead, investing in durable improvements that promote long-term economic activity is preferable.\n\nOne way to achieve this goal is by investing in programs that loan money forward or establish scholarships or infrastructure, such as roads or solar installations, that promote economic activity. Microfinance can assist hundreds or thousands of people in the United States or developing countries by allowing them to borrow small sums. Alternatively, scholarships can be established or added to existing programs to advance educational opportunities. In addition, a solar prize program can incentivize families struggling to pay utilities while promoting renewable energy sources.\n\nWhether investing during regular business cycles or spending during a recession, it is critical to ensure that the money has a societal return. An investment can establish a new business, train a capable employee, or improve transportation access, which benefits individuals and society as a whole. Thus, the aim must be to make the money do double duty to create lasting benefits that promote economic activity."}

{"178": "\n\nConsider purchasing a used car instead of leasing. Audi cars are known for their quality and popularity, and a 2007 Audi A4 costs around $7,000. Investing in a high-quality old car can save you money compared to the costs of leasing a newer car or buying a fad car or overpriced SUV. Full-sized sedans are also generally considered safer. Additionally, selling any overseas property now in a strong real estate market is a good financial decision. To plan for the future, consider your investment timeline, factoring in any plans for medical school or other future expenses. Remember, every investment involves both buying and selling, so focus on finding revenue-generating assets that align with your area of expertise. For example, software businesses can benefit from investing in revenue-generating assets like ANSYS licenses, which can be brokered or resold for a profit. Ensure that any investment you make is a revenue-generating asset that will help build your financial portfolio."}
{"179": "\n\nReal estate can yield profits in two ways: through its increasing value or its ongoing returns, much like a stock's appreciation and dividends. However, acquiring either can be mistaken, with studies showing that many investors underperform the market. Given that real estate is not a homogenous asset class, investments vary across regions. For example, a $200K house that rents for $1,000 is a different investment from a $100K three-family that rents for $2,000 total rents. Looking at the ratio between price and rent, which can be affected by interest rates, can assist in determining whether prices are too high, a bargain, or somewhere in between. For the most part, median home prices tend to track median income long term. While real estate can be a smart investment if done correctly, purchasing a property to rent and purchasing a primary residence are different economic decisions. Often, homebuyers buy larger houses than necessary, thus turning their apparent profit into a loss. For example, a buyer who should purchase a $150K house instead of renting may opt for the $225K house due to pressure from real estate agents or lenders, causing a 1/3 increase in expenses. It is comparable to renting a 1,000 square-foot apartment but opting for one that is 1,500 square feet solely for the view."}
{"180": "\n\nRevised: There is no magic formula for getting out of debt, but the process is simple: earn more, reduce expenses, and pay off loans. Based on what you've shared, it seems like you could use some assistance with increasing your income. While your career focus is admirable, have you considered starting a low-cost side business, such as tutoring, consulting, or babysitting? Another option is working a part-time job outside of your field, such as waiting tables or working at a gas station. \n\nCreating a written budget each month is highly recommended. It will help you plan how to allocate your money and prioritize paying off your loans. Following the debt snowball method (paying off the smallest or highest interest loan first) can help you gain momentum and motivation. It would be wise to keep good records and set goals in order to stay on track. \n\nUsing the cash envelope system can also be effective. If you and your spouse use this method, you may find that you have extra money to put toward your debt. If you contribute to a 401(k), consider reducing your contribution to just the matching amount or even zero in order to prioritize paying off your loans. Remember that paying off loans takes time and effort, but with persistence and commitment, it is achievable. It's important not to neglect any of your loans, regardless of their interest rates."}
{"181": "\n\nTo start, it is important to determine the asset class mixture of both your current and new portfolios. If the mixture is the same and you are only changing the funds used to invest in those classes, then you can make the change all at once. This wouldn't pose any market risk, and you can confidently switch to funds that follow your desired asset classes. \n\nHowever, if you're also adjusting your asset class mixture, the size of the change will dictate your approach. Ideally, it's best to make the whole change at once, but if you're worried about potential fluctuations, you can gradually rebalance towards your final position by taking intermediary steps. In this case, you would begin by changing all of the funds, but perhaps in a mix closer to your current asset mixture. Over the next few months, you could adjust the ratios to reach your desired asset mix."}

Trading warrants are commonly used in trade and are similar to options with calls and puts. Financial companies issue them, unlike exchange-traded options that other investors usually write. Conversely, investors hold installment warrants for an extended period with no calls or puts. Financial companies also issue installment warrants. For instance, an underlying stock may have installment warrants costing $27 per warrant while purchasing it directly costs $50 per share. The interest component inherent in the warrant covers the borrowing costs until expiry when the buyer pays the strike price ($28) and receives the underlying shares. Full dividends still apply to installment warrants at a higher cost than shares. Unlike options and trading warrants, installment warrants have an additional advantage of full dividends."}

{"186": "\n\nAnnuities, much like life insurance, are typically not sought out by the customer. Historically, non-spouse beneficiaries of an IRA had only two options: (a) withdraw all funds within five years or (b) receive equal installments over their expected lifetime. If the second option was selected, a fixed-term annuity was issued by the IRA custodian in exchange for the IRA assets. In the event that the IRA contained shares of stock, the custodian was then responsible for paying a set amount annually to the beneficiary for a predetermined period of time, usually around 23 years. This meant that the beneficiary no longer had control over their investments, could not transfer funds to a different broker or sell the investments and invest elsewhere. Additionally, the custodian had no obligation to do anything, other than pay out the predetermined annual amount. Under the previous IRA rules, financial planners had a strong incentive to encourage the beneficiary to withdraw all the funds and invest in stocks or mutual funds through their firm. The company would often guarantee a larger annual amount than the custodian, pay out more in any year the investments did well, and continue payment until the beneficiary or their spouse passed away. Furthermore, in the event of premature death, the company would return the entire investment amount (minus any payouts already made). This seemed like the ideal solution for beneficiaries; however, the planner's commission and the high surrender charges on the mutual funds were not usually disclosed."}

{"188": "If it were up to me, I would suggest organizing your documents in the following manner. Firstly, arrange everything by year, with major categories such as Mortgage, Utilities, Credit, Major Purchases, Home Improvement and Other listed underneath. With regard to the \"Other\" category, as it is likely to contain smaller items, it would be advisable to break it down into monthly segments to make it easier to sort through. However, this would not be necessary for the other categories as the items listed within them would be limited. It would be helpful to name each receipt clearly and scan them regularly, so that you can easily sort them by date or by name within any of the larger categories. Consider using a cloud service like DOXO to store your documents for added security and accessibility.\n\nFor retention purposes, I suggest keeping anything related to your mortgage, home maintenance, and improvements, including receipts, as these contribute to the cost basis of the house when it is sold. Small receipts and utility bills can generally be discarded after 7 years as they are unlikely to be needed. Lastly, it is important to ensure regular backups offsite, either through cloud storage or a backup service, to safeguard against loss due to unforeseen circumstances such as a house fire or theft."}

{"190": "\n\nWhen examining similar or identical ETFs, it is crucial to consider two key factors: the typical spread and the trading volume and size of the ETF. Thinly traded ETFs may have large spreads between buy and sell, often ranging from 1.5-2% or higher. This can be a significant inconvenience if frequent transactions are made, far outweighing any differences in ongoing charges. Poor spreads are typically related to a lack of liquidity, and illiquid assets are more likely to disconnect from underlying assets in situations where authorized participants face trouble. However, with stock ETFs that trade in very liquid markets, this has traditionally been less of an issue. For average retail investors, the impact on the typical spread is much more important than point #3, which would create an arbitrage that authorized participants would quickly seize on. To better understand how this works, it's beneficial to read up on the creation and redemption mechanism, which is critical to how ETFs operate."}
{"191": "\n\nRefining your inquiry, I believe there is a more effective approach, but it requires modifying how you manage your expenses, which may not be of interest to you. Currently, you manually monitor your expenditures and enter them into a system every day. However, if you shift to exclusively using a debit or credit card to pay for everything, you can bypass this manual entry process by importing your transactions from your bank. I understand your bank does not support exporting, but it may be possible for them to integrate with a tool like Wave Accounting (http://www.waveaccouting.com), which is specifically designed for small business accounting and free to use. (Full disclosure: I work for Wave.)\n\nIf your bank still cannot support exports or Wave's connections, it may be worthwhile to consider switching to a different bank. Even though changing banks may be inconvenient, you will save a significant amount of time and resources over the year and reduce the likelihood of human error compared to entering receipts manually. In Wave, you can still input all of your cash receipts manually if you want to stick with your current approach of cash payments.\n\nOne crucial aspect to keep in mind when looking for a better solution is ensuring that your data is adequately backed up, as losing it all in the event of a computer malfunction would be a nightmare. Wave Accounting backs up your data every hour and utilizes bank-level security measures to safeguard your information.\n\nLastly, it bears repeating that Wave Accounting is available for free.

{"193": "\n\nA Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a derivative contract wherein its value is dependent on another asset. Simply put, a CDS is a swap that occurs when a default transpires. Generally, a holder of non-risk free credit will enter into an agreement with a counterparty to exchange a portion of the income received from the non-risk free credit for the ability to force the counterparty to deliver risk-free credit in cases of default. Banks make use of this mechanism to mitigate loan risks while compiling them for resale to investors. Banks will usually purchase CDSes on mortgages and corporate bonds, paying a fraction of the interest payments received for the right to force counterparties (typical hedge funds and insurance companies) to swap national Treasuries in the event of mortgage or corporate defaults. Although banks receive less income, they are able to increase their inventory to sell to investors, allowing more loans to be offered to borrowers, households, and corporations. Hedge funds usually adopt more complex arrangements, while insurance companies sell CDSes as they are usually awash with risk-free assets, but are lacking in income."}

{"196": "\n\nA bull strategy is when an investor bets on a rising market. On the other hand, puts are a type of stock option that allows the seller to promise the buyer 100 shares of stock at a pre-agreed price, known as the strike price, on any day before the expiration day. The buyer of the put option has the option to sell, but is not obligated to do so. In contrast, the seller of the put option is required to fulfill their promise to the buyer. If necessary, the broker can require the seller of the put option to have margin to ensure they can fulfill their promise. \n\nThe buyer of the put option can profit if the stock price decreases significantly. Additionally, the buyer of the put option can sell the option to someone else without owning the stock. If the buyer of the put option also owns the stock, it can function similarly to an insurance policy on the value of the stock. On the other hand, the seller of the put option earns a profit if the stock price remains the same or increases. This means that the seller benefits if they sell put options that no one uses by the expiration day. \n\nA spread refers to an investment that involves buying one option and selling another. For example, a bull put spread investor may sell the 600 JAN put and buy the 550 put for Apple Inc. (AAPL). If the price of AAPL rises beyond 600, the investor would profit from the difference between the prices of the puts. However, in the worst case scenario, if AAPL falls below 550, the bull put spread investor owes $5000 in JAN but received $2035 for taking this risk. In this particular example, the outcome was the worst case scenario, resulting in a loss of $2965. In the best case scenario, if AAPL stays above 600 on expiration day in JAN, the net profit would be $2035. The break even point for this investment would be if AAPL drops to 579.65, at which point the value of the 600 JAN AAPL put sold would equal the $2035 collected, resulting in a break even outcome. Commission fees were not considered in this example."}

What is the purpose of the wash sale rule? We can explain the workings of tax code effectively, and suggest the implications thereof, but understanding the history behind specific rules may be challenging.

This is common practice for companies that go public. The first investor, often the founder, invests capital to start the company, even if it's from their own bank account. The difference between a \"normal\" investor and an \"angel investor\" lies in their approach to investing. Angels are private investors who invest their own money in start-ups at very early stages. They invest at stages where entrepreneurs typically struggle to raise capital because there's no real business or products, just an idea or patent. These investors gamble with small amounts of money relative to their wealth - tens of thousands of dollars or sometimes a hundred or two thousand. Success in this type of investing can reap high rewards. Angel investors are like any other investors, and depending on their stake in a company, they can influence its decisions."}

This has consistently worked for me with various providers, resulting in lowered bills typically less than half of the original amount. While I cannot definitively say the reason for the reduction, it could be due to insurance payments, added credits or disappearing line items.

{"208": "\n\nAs a dealer who specializes in subprime sales, it is important to note that financing typically incurs higher costs than purchasing with cash. This is because every financed deal involves a lender who takes a percentage of the total value as a \"discount.\" Consequently, dealers may be hesitant to provide a price before knowing whether a customer intends to pay in cash or finance. If a customer opts for a cash deal, the finance company will take a significant portion of the profit that would have been made on the sale. Ultimately, the dealer will be left with a lower profit margin or no deal at all. For example, if a car is worth $5000, and a customer wants to purchase it for $6000 with financing, the finance lender may charge a \"buy-fee\" of $1200, leaving the dealer with only $4800 in profit. Thus, it is important to consider the cost of financing when making a purchasing decision."}

{"212": "\n\nThe market maker always compares the highest bid and lowest ask, with a trade occurring if the highest bid is at least equal to the lowest ask. However, adding shares at a higher asking price will not have any effect, as no one will buy them. On the other hand, placing a higher bid for shares will trigger a sale. For instance, bidding $210 for shares offered at $200 will result in purchasing those shares for $210. If bidding for one million shares, the same process applies until all shares with an ask up to $210 are bought or a million shares are purchased. When dealing with AAPL, bidding a higher price typically drives the share price upwards, resulting in making people happy but losing money. In case of a smaller company, if you drive the share price up to $210, but there are no other bidders above $200, no one else will buy your shares. It is important to note that this would be market manipulation and is illegal in several countries. Even if you lose out in the process, you may still face criminal charges."}

If this is not an option, I can pay the company back the $1600 every month. It's important to note that regularly using the business card for personal expenses can potentially pierce the corporate veil and jeopardize the company's financial protections.

For instance, if I can purchase diamonds with my credit card at a local mall, why would I choose your alternative payment options? Furthermore, most items you are selling are probably available from other vendors as well."}
{"224": "\n\nRevised: Comparing a broker's advertisement of their \"huge access\" to dark pools to a car dealer advertising their ability to sell Chevrolets is inaccurate. Most brokers utilize dark pools, either their own or belonging to a larger financial institution, as it is a primary source of their income. They can internalize orders in their own dark pool or send them to a larger institution's pool and receive a fraction of the profit in return. While Mom and Pop may benefit from some order types and receive a free penny from the trade, the absence of dark pools would have resulted in their counterparty receiving half of the $1.00 difference in their trade prices, reducing their profit. Thus, brokers' advertisements of their dark pool access is irrelevant as it barely benefits the customers while making a higher profit for the broker. A less liquid product can intensify this situation, with Mom and Pop still receiving a penny each while the broker earns $4.98 on a 100 share trade."}

{"226": "\n\n\"Why would I, as a shareholder, approve an increase in the number of authorized shares?\" This decision can potentially increase the value of your existing shares. Companies issue new shares to raise capital, which they may utilize to expand their operations or achieve other objectives. If Whole Foods, for example, issues new shares and uses the capital to open new stores, the profit may increase enough to offset the dilution effect and drive up the stock price. As a shareholder, you should consider where your company plans to expand and how likely that expansion is to succeed. Additionally, you may want to evaluate other ways in which the company could raise capital, such as taking on debt, using existing cash reserves, or cutting expenses elsewhere. Assuming you believe that the management has a solid expansion plan in place, authorizing new shares may be a wise choice for your personal investment."}

{"228": "\n\nWhat does a negative Total Equity signify in McDonald's balance sheet? It indicates that the company's liabilities surpass its total assets. While this could suggest that a company has incurred losses over time, it is not the only explanation. Despite McDonald's being a profitable company, it doesn't necessarily translate to a healthy financial state. Perhaps, the company has taken out significant loans to finance operations, leading to a debt load too heavy to bear. In McDonald's case, its equity change is primarily due to the stock buyback of over $20 billion in recent years, which reduces assets and equity. Had the company opted to pay off its debts instead, its equity wouldn't be negative. Nonetheless, the interest rate on the debt might be low enough to make buying back stock a better financial decision. However, assessing such a scenario would require taking many variables into account, which aren't feasible in this forum."}
{"229": "When making any transaction in life, whether financial or otherwise, it is important to prioritize your personal needs and comfort. If a cheaper option does not make you feel comfortable, do not hesitate to pay more for an experience that aligns with your expectations. Saving money in the short-term may ultimately result in greater costs in the form of headaches and annoyances. If something or someone makes you uncomfortable, it is best to walk away and avoid any confrontations. The worth of money lies in its ability to connect the needs of one party with the solution provided by another. Therefore, a positive customer service experience should be the objective for any business. Outdated sales tactics such as aggression are not effective in building lasting relationships with customers. It is important to consider whether the salesperson's behavior is indicative of their overall competence in their business, or if it is just a communication issue. In the case of musical instruments, it may be useful to separate the buying experience from the maintenance and repair experience. Ultimately, trust your intuition and seek out options that prioritize your needs and make you feel valued as a customer."}

Since you are likely decades away from that age, I recommend choosing a \"target year fund\" that corresponds to the year you turn 59.5. This investment strategy involves gradually shifting your portfolio from a higher concentration of stocks to more bonds as you approach retirement age. The stock market is more volatile, but its average gains can help protect your funds against inflation, while bonds offer stability and protection against potential market dips. By taking market risks earlier in life, you can benefit from potential gains, and transition to stability when you retire and depend on the savings."}

It's important to note that you will incur federal, state, and Social Security taxes, but this is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, paying taxes means you have likely earned a substantial income!

{"232": "The economist and Nobel laureate, Paul Krugman, wrote about the impact of money supply on economic expansion using a baby-sitting co-op as an analogy. While the example may be simplistic, it effectively demonstrates how printing and restricting money can affect an economy. Krugman's analysis highlights the importance of establishing a fair system for distributing tokens or markers in a co-op to ensure that all members contribute equally. However, the number of tokens must be carefully balanced to avoid hoarding or shortage. If there are too few tokens, parents may be unwilling to go out and leave their children because they need to save tokens for their own future use. Conversely, if there are too many tokens, babysitting opportunities become scarce, which may discourage parents from participating in the co-op altogether. Krugman's analysis emphasizes the delicate balance needed to maintain a healthy economy."}

Your total monthly payment will be $1,099.45 \u2013 $5,000 amortized at 2.94% for 14 months plus $10,300 divided by 14, which equals $363.74 + $735.71.

Even if your lender doesn't credit your additional payment to the principal, and instead credits it to future payments, you'll still be done in 15 months and the total interest expense will be around $447.

{"238": "\n\nRevised: A depreciating AUD is beneficial to exporters, which in turn benefits the economy. This can lead to an increase in employment and disposable income, encouraging increased consumer spending, including on housing. However, one should consider that an improving economy and rising property market may trigger an increase in interest rates, which can have a dampening effect on the housing market. As a potential property buyer, it is important to assess your borrowing limits and include a buffer of 2% to 3% above current interest rates. Additionally, be cautious of the doomsayers predicting a property crash, as these predictions have been made before but not proven accurate. It is possible to negotiate a better deal when interest rates are high, and then benefit from lower repayments and increased property prices when interest rates decrease. In Australia, a significant property crash is unlikely as long as economic conditions remain stable and housing supply is limited. As for your personal plan to buy a property with a monthly mortgage repayment of $2500, taking on a fixed rate for five years and intending to sell in two years, it is important to carefully weigh the costs against potential gains. A better strategy may be to consider a 10-20 year time horizon and aim for long-term capital appreciation, as well as ensuring that monthly mortgage repayments are affordable even with potential interest rate hikes."}

{"243": "\n\nI'm not familiar with Transferwise and how they operate, but when I needed to transfer money internationally, I used a foreign currency transfer company that required the details of the destination account, such as a GBP account in the UK in your case, as well as money from the source account. This would mean that your father would need to open an EUR account, potentially in an EU country (if available), though a UK account may also be suitable based on any associated transfer fees. It's worth exploring other business accounts besides HSBC, such as Santander, which I have used before. Only one foreign exchange transaction takes place with this setup, which is performed by the specialized company (there are several of these), and their spread (the difference between the interbank exchange rate and the rate you receive) will likely be around 1.0 - 1.5%. In addition, there are transfer fees associated with the FX company's account, usually a flat fee of $25 for the SWIFT payment. The remaining balance, less the spread, will then be transferred to your GBP account in the UK. There are still operating costs associated with both the EUR and GBP accounts, but with that said, it's essential to shop around for offers/free banking periods etc. Ultimately, despite the costs associated, this may be a better deal for you overall than having HSBC handle everything due to potential savings from FX conversion."}

One option is receiving payment via cheque, but the downside of this method is that it takes time for the cheque to be delivered and cleared.

Another alternative is COD, where you can charge the customer for the item at the post office and have them pay upon delivery. The post office will pay you upon sending the package, but there is a fee for this service. Another option is money orders, but be sure to request an International Money Order as Domestic Money Orders can only be cashed at US post offices. Delivery time can be an issue with this option, as well as verifying that the customer sent an International Money Order. The most convenient option may be accepting credit card payments, as there are many providers available at a lower cost than banks.

{"247": "\n\nThis response is partly incomplete as I do not have definitive conclusions regarding some parts of your question. Your question has specific sub-questions which would be best answered by the investment companies you are considering. In addition, there is no specific statement regarding TIAA-CREF fees. So, it is advisable to contact them directly to inquire. While there is mention of no-transaction-fee funds on their site, no list of such funds was found. For Vanguard, they also offer non-Vanguard funds without transaction fees. To locate such funds, visit their mutual funds page, click on the drop-down menu, select other fund companies, and view the list of funds with \"NTF\" by their name. Other companies such as Scottrade also offer NTF funds which could be located using their screener and filters such as \"no load\" and \"no transaction fee\". You are correct to choose an option that provides a good selection of funds that can be bought without transaction fees. However, there are several options other than Vanguard and TIAA-CREF, as shown above. Most firms that have their funds, including TIAA-CREF and Vanguard, offer a range of funds for free, and many places also sell other companies' funds for free. It merely depends on the preference for funds. On searching for IRA providers, there will be a surplus of options available. Vanguard is a leader in low-cost index funds, and TIAA-CREF and Fidelity are other options available. However, realistically, it is not necessary to choose from a vast array of funds.

{"249": "\n\nA credit union operates in a similar manner to a bank, using deposits from checking, savings, money market accounts, Certificates of Deposit, or IRAs to provide loans for various purposes such as auto, boat, mortgage, school, second mortgage, and lines of credit. Government regulations mandate the percentage of each type of deposit that must be retained for non-loan transactions. Credit unions are owned by their members and have no external investors as their aim is not profit but to serve their shareholders. Generally, credit unions offer a more attractive package compared to banks due to the absence of pressure to generate profits. Fees are generally lower and intended to deter negative behavior rather than profit from it. Dividends and interest are treated the same way as bank interest and are reported to the IRS similarly. However, credit unions must abide by certain peculiar rules such as the maximum number of transactions allowed between accounts and strict membership requirements, which are designed to make it harder for individuals to become members of a credit union by banks."}

Although they may know who you are, all you know about them is their company name and phone number, both of which can disappear quickly, leaving you with nothing. If they have promised to pay off your debt and issue a new loan, it is reasonable to allow them to complete the task before payment is made.

It is recommended to consult with a licensed tax advisor (EA/CPA in your State) for guidance. If payments are made to you individually (1099), they should be reported on your Schedule C, and you will need to pay SE taxes on it. If payments are made to the corporation, the corporation will pay you a salary and handle the associated payroll taxes.

{"254": "\n\nWe are purchasing a home for just over $200,000, which means that he will only need to contribute around $7,000. However, I agree with the others that we shouldn't call this a gift unless it truly is a gift. I suggest that he contacts the bank that previously denied him a mortgage to see if putting both of us on the mortgage would alleviate their concerns. Our cash flow will cover the mortgage payment, and if we are unable to make payments, they can fall back on his contribution. This solution may work for them, even though they would decline individual loans. This scenario works in his favour as he was prepared to take on the entire loan, and it works for us too as our current plan would make us solely responsible for the loan.\n\nWhat percentage of ownership and future expenses do you suggest? Typically, a cash/financing partnership is split 50/50. However, since we are only contributing a 3.5% down-payment instead of the usual 20%, is a 50/50 split still fair? Surprisingly, a 3.5% down-payment accrues half the equity of a 20% down-payment, which means your proposed 25%-75% split makes sense.\n\nI calculated his share to increase based on his equity share of the monthly payment, which I set to the principal plus interest payment for a thirty-year loan. With a 20% down-payment, this would give him 84% equity, and with 3.5%, it equates to around 40% equity. I'm unsure why 84% equity is considered a 50% share. However, it may be due to additional expenses. If we exclude property taxes, it may reduce the equity share.\n\nPlease note that if we increase the down-payment to 20%, our mortgage payment will decrease significantly, and we can eliminate any PMI payment. Additionally, we could argue that if he pays a third of the monthly mortgage payment, it would give him the same 50% equity stake on a 3.5% down-payment as he would get with a 20% down-payment. But this means he would effectively subsidize my monthly payment, and if he were to stop paying, my rent would increase by 50%.\n\nTherefore, I suggest I handle the monthly payment and he handles the down-payment. In case of an emergency, he can take over the mortgage if necessary. However, if he is unable to pay his third of the mortgage, I may not be able to find someone to replace him or take over his share. My brother can construct a plan where I inherit his equity in case of tragedy so that we can continue paying the mortgage and not lose our equity in the house. This solution ensures stability and protects us from financial loss."}
{"255": "\n\nRevised: \n\nContrary to popular belief, adding a large number of shares to a stock that constitutes a significant portion of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) may not necessarily result in an increase in the index. This is because the DJIA is a price-weighted index, not a market-cap weighted one; other possible weightings include equal weighting. The DJIA, composed of 30 blue-chip companies, was introduced in May 1896. Therefore, even if new shares are added through a stock split, the value of the DJIA will not necessarily be equivalent to the sum of the share prices of its constituents. Similarly, dilution of earnings does not always translate to a direct impact on stock prices, especially if there are exercised options or secondary offerings. \n\nIn the event of an increase in the index, such as in the absence of additional buying activity in the ETF, the ETF DIA may still experience a rise. If the ETF's increase is not proportional to that of the index, an arbitrage opportunity arises for investors to buy the DIA shares, which can then be redeemed for the underlying stocks that have a higher value. For further information, refer to the Creation and Redemption Unit process outlined in ETFs."}

{"258": "\n\nThe \"Do You Have To File?\" section of the Form 1040 (U.S. tax return form) Instructions determines whether an individual is required to file a tax return based on their income. Various factors, including dependency status and marital status, affect the income threshold at which one is required to file. If an individual is unmarried, under 65 years of age, and not blind, they should refer to Chart B to determine whether they meet the conditions to file a tax return. If their unearned income was over $1050, their earned income was over $6,300, or their gross income was more than either $1,050, or the sum of their earned income (up to $5,950) plus $350, they are required to file. Keep in mind that income from YouTube counts as earned income for these purposes. However, if an individual is self-employed, they must also consider Chart C.

For instance, in India, a research assistant at a college earns approximately a third of what I earn in the US. Although my cost of living may decrease when living in India, my salary would also reduce accordingly. There are websites that provide guidance on the average salary for specific professions with varying years of experience. However, some individuals may receive more or less than the average salary, making it challenging to compare between countries. Nonetheless, if one is paid more than the average salary in the US, it's likely that they would also receive an above-average wage in other regions. Besides, moving to a developing country may provide a positive pedigree bias.\n\nVarious websites offer purchasing power parity for different currency pairs. However, the lifestyle one experiences in a specific country is unique and difficult to replicate elsewhere. Trying to compare similar things between countries can be misleading. For instance, a friend of mine moved from the US to India, where they received a tremendous salary compared to the typical Indian income. Unfortunately, a house similar to what they had in the US was only affordable to CEOs of top companies in India's Bangalore region. Considering such aspects is crucial, such as being content with living in a three-room apartment compared to an independent bungalow with a basement and attic with four bedrooms equivalent to what my friend had in the US. It's common for individuals in the US to drink Starbucks coffee a couple of times a day, while in India, this is considered a luxurious lifestyle. Similarly, fast food items such as McBurgers in India cost around Rs 100 while a Wada Pav is sold for Rs 10. Availability and prices of food items vary, making it necessary to budget when in a foreign country.\n\nDifferent countries have varied social structures, such as the possibility of affording house help, including maids, drivers, plumbers, and electricians. For instance, when in the US, I couldn't afford such help, while in India, I have a cooking maid, driver, plumber, and electrician, all at an affordable rate. Such help is typically unaffordable for most individuals in the US. In the UK, a colleague preferred to live in a specific locality due to the presence of a good church. Likewise, one may find a good church that aligns with their beliefs in India.\n\nIt's necessary to consider other factors such as citizenship, which may differ from one country to another. A foreign national may never acquire Indian citizenship, and children do not qualify unless both parents are Indian. Health care also varies from one country to another, making it essential to research beforehand. Traffic, cleanliness, culture, and climate are among the various other factors to consider when planning to relocate.\n\nIt's worth noting that research assistants in India are generally poorly paid due to the lack of funds in colleges. Additionally, fundamental science research is low, and the linkages between industry and universities are primitive, unlike in the US."}

{"265": "\n\nI believe that the common response to the question of why mutual funds are priced once per day is often \"that's just how it's done,\" without any real justification. However, it is likely that historical reasons played a role in establishing this practice, as it used to be more difficult to calculate and update a fund's value before the availability of real-time quotes. This may have led to laws that mandated once-a-day pricing. \n\nThere are, however, fundamental differences between stocks and mutual funds that make pricing them differently necessary. When a person buys a share of stock, they are trading a finite piece of ownership in the company with another person, bartering to agree on a price. In contrast, buying into a mutual fund means that the fund uses the subscription amount to purchase shares of underlying stocks. The value of the mutual fund is therefore determined by the total weighted value of these underlying stocks, and there is only one reasonable way to price it. \n\nAlthough there is no inherent reason why mutual fund pricing cannot be done instantaneously, people typically do not buy and sell funds to each other directly. Instead, they deposit or withdraw from the fund manager, who is only legally required to price the fund once a day. Therefore, they typically only do so once a day. \n\nAs someone with limited knowledge of finance and markets, I am wary of answers that simply say \"that's how it's always been done\" and prefer explanations grounded in reason and evidence."}

{"267": "\n\nThe solution you seek is already available in the form of Unit Investment Trusts. These trusts begin with a fixed pool of securities that are not actively managed and remain unchanged throughout their lifespan. Upon termination, all assets are distributed among the owners. Professionals carefully select the securities to meet specific investment goals such as growth, income, or capital appreciation, according to the Investment Company Institute. Units are sold through a one-time public offering, and the strategy utilized is buy-and-hold. By doing so, unit holders know precisely what they're investing in, as all securities appear in the prospectus. Redeemable units are usually sold, meaning the trust is obligated to repurchase the investors' units at their net asset value whenever requested."}
{"268": "\n\nInvestors typically have a place on the company's board of directors, and their ownership in the business gives them a vested interest in its stock price. Similarly, management may have an aligned interest in the stock price if they hold a certain percentage of equity in the company."}
{"269": "\n\nInvesting in bonds with negative yields means that instead of making a profit on your investment, you will actually end up losing money. This is a new practice implemented by financial institutions worldwide, where the interest rate could be as low as -0.05% for a ten-year investment. For a $100,000 bond, this means the value would be discounted to $100,501. The return on investment would be calculated as (Principle $100,000)- (Negative Yield @ -0.05) x (10 Years), assuming simple annual rates. \n\nOne may wonder why someone would buy such an investment that not only eliminates possible profits, but also decreases the principal amount. However, there are valid reasons for issuing or investing in such bonds. From an investor's perspective, every asset has an \"expense\" associated with it, including currency, depending on its size and other investment possibilities and risk factors. For example, people with a lower income but steady cash flow may choose a savings account that yields a positive rate of interest, while business professionals may prefer a checking account. \n\nSimilarly, people with large sums of money with no secure investment opportunities have the option of keeping the money idle, which involves additional expenses, risks, and headaches. Alternatively, they could choose to invest in bonds issued by the government, even if they have negative yields. This is because investing in these bonds provides security and a risk-free guarantee of getting their money back on time. \n\nFrom the government's perspective, issuing negative interest-bearing bonds encourages people to invest their money in sectors that could be profitable for both the investor and the greater community, ultimately benefiting the country. \n\nIn conclusion, negative interest bonds are a relatively new concept, aiming to provide a secure investment for people with large sums of money. While they may appear counterintuitive, they serve a purpose for both investors and governments."}
{"270": "\n\nI acknowledge that you should have received both a 1099 and a W2 from your employer. However, some employers may be hesitant to do so due to the fear of triggering an IRS audit. The determination of independent contractor versus employee should be based on job function, not personal preference. If your job function did not change when you switched from contractor to employee, the IRS could argue that you should have been classified as an employee the entire time, along with other similar contractors at the company. Thus, the employer may be unwilling to address the issue. \n\nRegarding your concern about \"Federal and FICA W/H together,\" does this total appear in box 4 of your 1099? If yes, the employer may expect you to reimburse the employer's portion of FICA. You can ask if they already paid it or not. If they did, then they should issue a W2 since the IRS expects it. If not, the cost to you would be 7.65% of what your W2 wages would have been. You can request that they issue a check for this additional amount. Please note that even though it is less than $600 and you won't receive a 1099 in 2017 for it, you are still required to pay taxes on it. I suggest estimating 10%. If the employer refuses to compensate you, you can threaten to fill out form SS-8. \n\nIn your situation, your employer is cheating by attempting to classify you as a 1099 contractor for the entire time instead of properly converting you to an employee. This is frowned upon by the IRS as well as by employees since it costs them more money in the form of employer FICA. It seems like your employer intended to help you but did not follow through properly. Ideally, they should have left you as a contractor if that was truly your job function, or completed the conversion process correctly."}

To let customers know what credit cards they accept, some businesses display stickers at their entrance. If you do not see your credit card listed, and you lack the necessary cash, ask about the accepted payment methods before placing an order. If the business does not accept your preferred payment method, it's best to take your business elsewhere. If you've already dined at the establishment and found yourself in an uncomfortable situation due to an assumption that your card would be accepted, consider writing an online review. Share your experience with other potential customers, but please be reasonable in your review. If the food and service were satisfactory, giving the business a one-star rating simply for not accepting credit cards is unfair. It's essential to note that businesses may choose not to accept credit cards for legitimate reasons, such as avoiding the additional costs incurred. However, there are also more questionable reasons. Accepting cash as payment allows for a lack of an electronic record of the transaction, leaving room for businesses to manipulate their income.

This decision is not for everyone, as one option for those facing a loss may be to borrow money against their land to rebuild their home, but this requires the ability to service two mortgages. Those without the means may need to go back to renting and paying off their original mortgage.

When it comes to credit card transactions, banks receive a fee from the retailer, who then inclines to incorporate a hidden charge that covers the fee. On large purchases like buying a car, retailers usually pay a fee that covers the usual interest rate. This step is taken because it drives sales for their business. In typical negotiations, the retailers will not offer low prices if you do not secure the 0% loan. However, in some situations, the seller may provide either a rebate or a low-to-zero finance rate, but not both."}
{"279": "\n\nAs you did not treat the house as a qualified business unit (QBU), you must use USD as your functional currency. To calculate capital gains, the USD value at the time of purchase using the exchange rate at the time of purchase and the USD value at the time of sale using the exchange rate at the time of sale must be calculated. The capital gain/loss is then the difference between the two figures. Further details on this can be found by following this link: http://www.maximadvisors.com/2013/06/foreign-residence/, which also discusses added potential complications if you have a mortgage on the house. For the court case referenced in the article (http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs5/93F3d26.html), Rev. Rul 54-105 is mentioned. The IRS website (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/0303021.pdf) also contains details from Rev. Rul. 54-105, 1954-1 C.B. 12, which states that for determining gain, the basis and selling price of property acquired by a U.S. citizen living in a foreign country should be expressed in United States dollars, using the rates of exchange prevailing as of the dates of purchase and sale of the property, respectively. While the text implies this is for US citizens living in a foreign country, the court case makes it clear this also applies in your scenario (house purchased while living abroad but now residing in the US). Appellants must translate the 453,374 pounds received for their residence at the $1.82 exchange rate prevailing at the date of sale, and the 343,147 pound adjusted cost basis of the residence, consisting of the 297,500 pound purchase price and the 45,647 pounds paid for capital improvements, must also be expressed in US dollar terms as of the date of the sale. While their argument may be fair and reasonable, it is an untenable attempt to convert their \"functional currency\" from the US dollar to the pound sterling. As outlined in I.R.C. \u00a7 985(b)(1), the use of a functional currency other than the US dollar is restricted to qualified business units (\"QBU\"s). As appellants' residence was not purchased or sold by a QBU, the district court rightly rejected their plea to treat the pound as their functional currency, although they correctly assert that their residence was bought for a pound-denominated value when they were living and working in a pound-denominated economy."}

Generally, the default approach is FIFO, meaning you are assumed to be ending the oldest position; however, you can alter this option if you prefer. It is not permitted to average the cost basis of stocks in the US (although this is allowed for mutual funds), so you must use either FIFO, LIFO (i.e. closing the last position first), or indicate the specific positions when submitting the sale order."}

Some tasks should not be done by yourself if you are not knowledgeable enough. Currently, we are doing freelance work under our personal names. What are the additional taxes we need to pay for the business compared to being a self-proprietor? (I heard that we do not need to pay additional taxes as long as our income is less than $200k, but not sure.) There will be no change in taxes unless you choose to have your LLC taxed as a corporation. As an LLC, it is a pass-through entity, and all income flows to personal tax returns. The LLC will be considered as a partnership from a tax perspective. It has to file form 1065 to report its income, and allocate the income to members/partners through schedules K-1. Members will use these numbers to pay taxes on their allocated income. Will the LLC result in additional taxes for my partner since she is out-of-state? Your employee's salary will not be affected, whether you operate as a sole proprietor, LLC, or corporation. What forms are needed when changing from freelance work to LLC? Normally, we receive 1099 forms; how will this change? If you are not a corporation, people who pay you over $600 annually must file a 1099 form. As an LLC, you will need to provide the partnership EIN instead of your SSN. Do LLCs have to pay taxes four times annually? Although we will hire an accountant, we will have months where we will not be working. Do we need to pay taxes quarterly? Unless you tax your LLC as a corporation, the LLC will have no taxes. You need to make sure that you have enough withholding to cover any additional income, or pay quarterly estimates. The threshold is $1000, and if you owe more than that, you will be penalized unless you paid the previous year's tax amount by either 100% or 110%. Our LLC will be 50-50, but we may not always split the income equally. Are we at risk if one partner earns more? Partnerships can be flexible, and the equity split does not have to be the same as income, loss, or asset split. However, you need to have a lawyer draft an operating agreement that defines all these splits to avoid issues later on."}

{"284": "\n\nRevised: \n\nVesting refers to the process of acquiring stock options, which is the right to purchase a specific amount of stock at a predetermined price. Your company is offering you options for 200,000 shares, but you can only acquire 25,000 shares initially. The remaining 175,000 shares have conditions attached, probably requiring you to still be employed by the company at a later time. Once the conditions are met, the option has vested, allowing you to exercise it at any time and acquire the related shares.\n\nOne way private companies make money for their shareholders is by paying dividends. The management of the company may decide to pay a dividend periodically, which could occur annually or more or less frequently. This payment is made by declaring a specific number of cents per share and multiplying that by the number of shares held by each shareholder. For instance, if you own 200,000 shares in your company after all your stock options have vested and the board declares a dividend of 10 cents per share, you would receive $20,000. Depending on your location and specific circumstances, you may have to pay taxes on this amount.\n\nWhile these are the basic concepts, there are numerous variations and complications that can arise, but this should provide you with an initial understanding."}

Publicly-visible funds, such as those managed by prominent index fund companies, tend to be less risky because they are not leveraged. \n\nContrary to the claim that a \"great many companies\" failed during the recession, the number of publicly-traded companies that went bankrupt was minimal.

However, investing in this area can be beneficial because, just like with bonds, it moves out of sync with US markets.

I personally have invested only a few percent of my total portfolio in an international stock index fund and an international REIT, both of which have low fees. (Low fees mean more of the money reaches you, and this is one of the main reasons to prefer one fund over another.) I made this investment based on my advisor's model and Monte Carlo simulations of my specific mix, which indicate that maintaining these investments at a low level is likely to result in better long-term outcomes.

{"307": "\n\nThe P/E ratio is a great tool to assess a company's price, but it's only valuable when compared to businesses in a similar industry, particularly those with well-established cash flows. For instance, let's examine Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) versus Hawaiian Electric (NYSE:HE), where we observe that HE has a notably higher P/E ratio. In essence, that indicates that HE may be overpriced relative to ED, although further investigation is necessary to confirm this. HE is exceptional in that it's a utility firm that also operates a bank, so this must be taken into account also. Rather than merely focusing on a \"magic number,\" conservative investors must consider their objectives and see the big picture. If capital preservation is your top priority, for example, you must ensure that your investments are diversified and appropriate. Given the 2011 interest rate scenario, this entails investing in short-term, high-quality bonds. Equities should be weighted towards large-cap with smaller holdings in international or commodity-related funds. Consider a blended or target-date fund like Vanguard's \"Life Strategy\" funds."}

Such an approach makes the account seem active, which reduces the cost for them to keep it open."}
{"311": "I apologize in advance for the length of this message. It appears that your friend may not have the necessary financial expertise to advise you on this matter. If they are also your financial advisor, they may be leading you towards a poor investment decision. Additionally, they seem to have a different investment model to the one you proposed, which may be causing confusion.\n\nTo clarify, the initial proposal was to take out a $10,000 loan, invest it, and not have any personal money tied up in it. However, since the loan does not appear to be interest-only and requires monthly payments, the principal payments need to be factored in as well. My analysis is correct, and the break-even point for an annual required return is in the low teens.\n\nRegarding the second proposal, your friend's analysis ignores certain factors, such as the loan's interest, which is not calculated correctly. \"Returns\" are a vague concept and need to be clearly defined in this context. It would help to build an amortization table for the loan in Excel.\n\nTo evaluate this proposed investment scheme, we need to consider various factors such as the loan amount, monthly payment, investment capital, monthly return, monthly contribution from your salary, taxes, and transaction fees. We can calculate the break-even point and total interest expense, which seems feasible. However, investing step-by-step may be a better option as it saves on interest and allows for dollar cost averaging in case the market goes down.\n\nUltimately, it is essential to consider various factors before making any investment decisions. While borrowing money may lead to more significant gains in some scenarios, it also comes with increased risk. Therefore, investing step-by-step may be a more practical and less risky option."}

Refinancing is a common service offered by various lenders, each with similar interest rates. However, smaller brokers tend to charge higher closing and application fees, while big banks make their revenue through loan servicing. If your mortgage qualifies, any lender can facilitate a \"streamline\" refinance. It is important to note that while your current mortgage servicer may not own the loan, they may continue servicing it. Therefore, renegotiating the rate is unlikely to be an option. Refinancing is the most feasible alternative, and the previous mortgage rate will not be taken into account."}
{"313": "\n\nWhile this strategy will work as intended, there is another point to consider regarding taxes on stock sales in the US. Short-term holdings, defined as held for less than one year, are subject to higher tax rates than long-term holdings. Both rates are determined based on your income bracket for fiscal year 2014 when filing as single. The minimum difference between capital gains tax rates for short and long-term holdings is ten percentage points, with the average difference being 15 percentage points. This percentage difference can have a significant impact on your tax liability. Therefore, if you anticipate a low income in the year you plan to sell your stocks, it may be advantageous to wait until you move to the US to sell the stocks and take advantage of the 0% tax rate. However, even if you choose to sell and rebuy, it's recommended to hold the position for at least one year from a tax optimization perspective. Two caveats to keep in mind as you consider this strategy are:"}
{"314": "\n\nBefore making any payments on your credit card, it's crucial to review the terms and conditions or contact your bank to understand how they will apply your payments. In the United States, minimum payments usually go towards the lower rate balance, and any amount above the minimum towards the higher rate balance. However, this can differ by country and law, so it's best to ask to avoid any confusion.\n\nIn case you owe a balance of $6000, with $5000 at a 13.5% purchase rate and $1000 at a 22% cash advance rate. If your bank spreads your payments proportionally, a $600 payment would reduce your purchase balance by $500 and your cash advance balance by $100. To calculate the average APR, you would take the sum of each balance multiplied by the corresponding APR and divide it by the total balance. This is known as a weighted average, which in this case would be 15%.\n\nHowever, if your bank applies payments differently, such as to the lower rate first or a specific amount to each rate, a calculator based on average APR would not accurately reflect your situation. To get a more precise estimate, you can treat the balances as separate loans or credit cards and allocate payments accordingly. Although this method may not be 100% accurate, it will give you a better idea of how long it will take to pay off each balance.\n\nOverall, it's essential to understand how your bank applies payments and to be aware of the impact on your balances, so you can make informed decisions when managing your credit card debt."}

{"316": "\n\nLet me share what I did in a similar situation. First, my spouse and I were able to save around $20K per year in our cash fund due to our two good incomes, and we could live comfortably on just one income if needed. Additionally, we had access to a HELOC with an interest rate of prime-1.5%. To maximize our interest savings, we mentally treated the HELOC as our emergency fund, allowing us to enjoy an annual interest savings of over $16,500 for the $100K invested with a sub-1% return. \n\nWhen I first shared this strategy, I received some criticism, which I understand as it may not work for everyone. However, I want to mention that now we owe $228K at a 3.5% interest rate. While we rarely used the equity line, and never exceeded $20K, we had to rely on this line of credit when both my spouse and I lost our jobs. Fortunately, we had previously planned for our retirement budget to include our current mortgage payment, with the mortgage being paid off in 12 years, after which we could start collecting Social Security. \n\nTo note, we had a 6-month severance pay and unemployment insurance to cover us for the first year. This strategy of combining severance and unemployment insurance was our first line of defense against unemployment, as suggested by Nick's excellent answer."}

This recommendation is based on two key factors: firstly, the escrow payment was subject to significant limitations as it was intended to cover the buyer's indemnification claims, and secondly, the taxpayer failed to opt-out of the installment method and incorrectly reported the entire gain, including the escrow payments, in the year of the transaction."}
{"319": "\n\nWhen it comes to capital losses and gains, their holding periods should be taken into account. If an asset or investment is held for a year or less and sold at a loss, it will create a short-term capital loss. However, if it's held for over a year and sold at a loss, it will result in a long-term loss. In order to report these on a tax return, a taxpayer must first categorize all gains and losses as long or short term and aggregate the total amounts. This process includes offsetting long-term gains and losses against each other and short-term gains and losses against each other. The final step is to offset the net long-term gain or loss against the net short-term gain or loss to arrive at a final net gain or loss. \n\nFor example, let's say Frank has $6,000 in short-term gains, $4,000 in long-term gains, $2,000 in short-term losses, and $5,000 in long-term losses from his stock trading for the year. His net short-term gain/loss would be $4,000 (calculated by subtracting the $2,000 short-term loss from the $6,000 short-term gain) and his net long-term gain/loss would be a $1,000 long-term loss (calculated by subtracting the $5,000 long-term loss from the $4,000 long-term gain). This would result in a final net gain/loss of $3,000 short-term gain (calculated by subtracting the $1,000 long-term loss from the $4,000 short-term gain). Frank can only deduct up to $3,000 of final net short- or long-term losses against other types of income for that year and must carry forward any remaining balance."}

{"322": "\n\nRevised Text:\n\nThe IRS provides guidance on business expense deductibility. In general, business expenses may be deductible depending on the circumstances and nature of the expense. Regarding travel expenses, taxpayers may deduct expenses related to business travel, such as transportation, lodging, and meals. Taxpayers are considered \"traveling away from home\" if their work requires them to be away for substantially longer than a regular workday and they need rest to meet work demands. Taxpayers can deduct actual meal expenses, which are generally limited to 50%, or use the standard meal allowance of $46/day for most small localities in the US. Only actual lodging expenses may be claimed, and receipts must be kept for documentation.\n\nEntertainment expenses may also be deductible if they are ordinary, necessary, and meet either the directly-related test or associated test. The directly-related test requires that the primary purpose of the entertainment activity is business conduct and that business was actually conducted during the activity with a specific expectation of future income or business benefit. The associated test requires that the entertainment was associated with active business discussion before or after the activity. More detailed information on deducting entertainment expenses is available in Publication 463.\n\nTaxpayers may also deduct the cost of gifts given in the course of their trade or business, but the deduction is generally limited to $25 per person per year. Additional information on the rules and limitations for deducting gifts can be found in Publication 463.\n\nIf an LLC reimburses business expenses that are not in compliance with IRS guidance, the reimbursement should be treated as income for tax purposes. For meal expenses, the standard meal allowance is the federal M&IE rate, which is $46/day for most small localities in the US. Alternatively, reimbursement can be made at a per diem rate."}

{"332": "\n\nInvestors with large holdings in a particular stock often have effective exit strategies to ensure they can sell their shares gradually and at the best available price. However, attempting to sell a single large block of shares can be problematic. For instance, if an investor has 100,000 shares to sell, it may be impractical to put them up for sale all at once, as it could take time for the market to absorb such a large transaction. When buying and selling stocks, market makers act as intermediaries who handle the majority of transactions between investors and the markets. Several market makers often trade in the same equity, competing with each other while setting their own bid and ask prices. This can result in a large number of different prices for the same stock. Although prices are set by the market makers, they wait until the volume of buying or selling moves prices. To determine how this will affect the share price, factors such as volume and the number of buyers versus sellers must be considered.

For simplicity, it is assumed that the investment in stocks is in indexed mutual funds and ETFs rather than individual stocks. An allocation of 90% in stocks is considered aggressive as a potential loss of 40% or more can occur in case of a stock market crash. However, since the investment is for the long term, the risk can be tolerated if the investor has the emotional willpower to stick with it. However, investing some money in bonds can slightly reduce the expected return but also reduce the standard deviation and maximum annual loss. Investing in a 60/40 portfolio might be too conservative and not recommended in the current financial climate. The expected return is highest with a 100% allocation in stocks for a 20-year window, but as the time horizon narrows closer to retirement, being more conservative is advised as there is less time to recover from a stock market crash.

While some 10-year periods may show stocks going nowhere, a diversified portfolio may make significant money, capitalizing on price volatility through rebalancing. Predicting \"dry periods\" in stocks is somewhat possible, but not necessary when rebalancing a balanced portfolio. Rather than focusing on beating the market, matching it, or maximizing returns, the goal should be to have the highest chance of financing non-financial goals, such as retirement or buying a house. Predictability is more important than maximized returns since realistic investment returns can never compensate for a low savings rate. While projections are useful, they do not match the unpredictability of real life. Plans that rely on extra returns are not reasonable since one cannot count on them.

If you are aiming to sell a stock when it falls to $1/share, a limit order at $3/share would be triggered, but I don't think this arrangement aligns with your intentions. Instead of combining them, it would be more beneficial to place two separate orders: a stop order to minimize losses and a limit order to sell. Combining them is unlikely to be effective."}

For brokerage accounts, you can contact your broker for instructions on how to name beneficiaries to inherit your account. Once you have named your beneficiaries, the account will be listed in your name, followed by the beneficiary's name. For those who have physical possession of stock certificates or bonds, new certificates must be issued to reflect ownership in beneficiary form. If you need assistance with this process, you can ask your broker for help or contact the transfer agent for the stock. Typically, the transfer agent will require you to send in the certificates, a stock or bond power form (if applicable), and a letter explaining your intentions."}
{"352": "\n\nAside from tradition and inflation, merchants likely play a role in keeping penny currencies in use. In the United States, the cost of goods has increased significantly over the past 75 years, with items that once cost $0.10 now costing $2.00. While inflation drives prices up, it doesn't necessarily prompt us to change our currency system. In the case of rounding errors, you may assume that these small discrepancies only occur a couple of times a day. However, for merchants conducting numerous transactions daily, a few cents can significantly impact their profits. Over a lifetime, individuals may encounter millions of transactions, potentially losing out on significant amounts of money due to rounding. Additionally, the suggestion that someone is always willing to pay for a worker's time during rounding is unrealistic. While it's a good sign to have an income that allows for indifference toward cents, some businesses profit from rounding practices. For many, including myself, it's essential to be aware of who has access to our money, with the government being a prime example of an entity that requires precise payments. Even the friendliest bartender who served me my drink could potentially benefit from rounding practices."}

Section 1256 Contracts result in a capital gain or loss, with 60% of that gain or loss deemed to be long-term and 40% deemed to be short-term. Essentially, this means 60% of your gains receive more favorable tax treatment. While this rule may seem arbitrary given its broad application, it is a valuable incentive for those employing Section 1256 Contracts, and it is what Buffett is referencing."}

{"355": "\n\nRevised: Here are some recommendations to consider:\n\n1) It's important to have a significant emergency fund (3-6 months of after-tax living expenses) to avoid downside risk. Unexpected needs for cash, such as job loss, car breakdown, or spending time with a relative, can significantly hurt your finances if your money is tied up in investments. Consider keeping cash equivalents like money market or short-term CDs, before investing in anything else.\n\n2) Lagerbaer's suggestion to reinvest dividends in S&P 500 index funds for a risk-free return of 3.5% over the last 5 years could be a good option.\n\n3) Take advantage of employer matching funds, such as a 401(k) at work, whenever possible. A dollar-for-dollar match is a risk-free pre-tax 100% return.\n\n4) If your portfolio has a 2/3 equity allocation, it's important to understand that there is a possibility that your balance could fall by 15% or more in any given year and take several years to recover. If such a decline would spook you, consider lowering your equity weights and investing in high-quality bond funds.\n\n5) Investing in stocks that you don't need back for 10 years is always a good idea, however, if you only want to invest for 2-5 years, it's risky. If prices fall, you may not have time to recover before you need your money back. Consider a different investment approach if your goals are short-term.\n\n6) If you plan to purchase a primary residence, borrowing from an investment account may incur significant taxes and fees if you don't pay it back. Saving enough to avoid PMI is a good risk-free return on your money.\n\n7) In general, ETFs or index funds like Vanguard are good choices to minimize expenses over the long-term.\n\n8) Instead of trying to time the market, be an investor and share in the profits of the companies you invest in, rather than focusing on trying to sell shares at a higher price than you bought. Consistently beating the market is not realistic for most people, so don't try to cash out at the \"perfect\" time.\n\nLastly, prioritize building your emergency fund before investing in anything else. After that, start investing for retirement and then consider other goals. Avoid using investment accounts for emergency funds due to inefficiencies in fees, commissions, and taxes. Best of luck!"}
{"356": "\n\nWhat are the benefits of buying a share? The value of a financial asset is determined by its ability to generate future cash flows. Therefore, the value of a share is influenced by the dividends it pays and its equity value. The equity value can be calculated in different ways, such as \"book\" value (assets minus liabilities) or projecting the company's free cash flow discounted to the present time. Typically, voting rights do not affect share prices, except in hostile takeover scenarios where someone acquires a significant number of shares to gain more influence in company decisions."}
{"357": "\n\nThis abbreviated balance sheet indicates that the company has a negative equity due to the fact that its liabilities exceed the value of its assets. This presents a major challenge for the company's ability to acquire credit to settle any debts that they incur with you. In light of this, it is recommended that you request upfront cash payments instead of extending them credit. It is unnecessary to review their income statement to determine their financial standing as their negative equity status is indicative of their financial difficulties. Should the company's income statement display positive results, you may wait and observe how they manage their liabilities before extending credit."}
{"358": "\n\nThe variable rate loan involves transferring some of the risk from the bank to the borrower, and assuming risk can often come with rewards, much like deductibles in insurance. The key to evaluating the viability of such deals is whether the borrower can handle the highest possible payments. If a borrower can manage the worst-case scenario, then the variable rate loan is an excellent option. However, if a borrower is near their loan limit, sticking with the safe bet of a fixed rate is wise. For mortgages, evaluating the maximum payment and resulting debt-to-income ratio is a simple and reliable way to determine affordability. In the past, variable rate loans came with higher initiation costs compared to fixed rates, but given the current rate differences, choosing a variable rate loan is a no-brainer for some borrowers."}

To arrive at this figure, we performed a calculation in Mathematica, setting the discounted future payments (p) equal to the present value (pv) of the loan and solving for the periodic interest rate (r). Further information on the calculation of effective interest rates can be found in this resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_interest_rate#Calculation."}
{"360": "\n\nAs JoeTaxpayer pointed out, you may be experiencing debit card holds and check clearing delays that are causing a hold on your funds. Even if the bank initially advised you of a one-day hold, that may actually refer to business days (Monday-Friday). This is because checks are not always immediately withdrawn from the sender's account, and the bank needs to verify that the money is being transferred before allowing access to the funds. If the check bounces, the bank may end up losing money, which is why they allow a smaller portion of the funds up front as a way to mitigate that risk. Typically, this amount varies among banks, but it is usually a small sum that the bank can afford to lose. For example, when I was first starting out, I typically had access to just $50 upfront. If you find that your bank frequently places holds on your funds, and you feel that this is inequitable, you might consider shopping around for a different bank. Many online banks offer more favorable policies around holds and access to deposited funds."}
{"361": "\n\nAlthough it is useful to know the software source, there are practical limitations to the IRS 1040EZ form that apply regardless of where you obtained it. This simplified tax form is not suitable for those who have passed a specific income threshold, as it only permits \"standard\" deduction and doesn't allow for itemization. When I first exceeded this income threshold, I was concerned that I had to pay thousands of dollars in taxes. However, changing to the 1040A (also known as the short form) and applying basic itemized deductions revealed that the IRS owed me a refund. I am uncertain of the income threshold for 2015 tax year, but as you approach $62k, the simplified form may not be the best choice. It may also seem that the free offering is only available for 1040EZ, based on information provided in other responses. This has historically been the case with other \"free\" software."}
{"362": "\n\nRevised:\n\nIt is highly irregular and inaccurate to include a company's stock in its Long Term Investments on the balance sheet. This would create divergent feedback loops, resulting in financial documents and stock prices that do not accurately represent the company\u2019s financial condition. The notion that a stock price is mentioned in financial documents is incorrect. Instead, stock prices are reported by parties external to the company, such as brokers at the stock exchange, and are negotiated between buyers and sellers, with the latest sale reflecting the price. Financial documents are prepared and audited internally and externally by the company and are presented to the market. \n\nAlthough stock prices do not directly feature in financial documents, they are useful for stakeholders within the company. For instance, they can provide guidance on the amount of money that can be raised by issuing or buying back stock. Raising capital is vital for expanding the company or securing funds when debt options are not ideal. Similarly, buying back stock can help major shareholders gain control of the company."}

For this particular case, the savings account is likely to return a larger amount if the conditions remain constant. The CD's interest rate is guaranteed, but the savings account's rate could change every business day, either going up or down. If you anticipate the savings account rate to be consistently higher than the CD, locking yourself into the CD may not be the best option. However, if you expect the savings rate to decrease, then the CD option may be more suitable for you; do keep in mind that there are penalties for early withdrawal of a CD."}
{"367": "\n\nAs a co-signer on his car loan, you do not have ownership unless the car is titled in both names. There are a few options available to you, but buying the car from him is not the best one. If you choose to purchase the car, you will need to arrange your own financing, either by taking over his loan or obtaining a loan of your own. The bank can assist in transferring the title to your name, and they will hold the title as long as the loan is not fully paid.\n\nThe best advice is to sell the car for the remaining balance on the loan, and then use the proceeds to purchase a reliable, used car outright, without the need for financing. If feasible, consider alternate methods of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit, to save thousands of dollars each year. This money can help you achieve financial independence sooner.\n\nIt's worth doing some research on this topic. In the US, we tend to view owning a car as a necessity, but this is not always the case. In fact, it's true less than half the time. Even if you cannot or prefer not to live within walking or biking distance of work, you can still save money by driving a fuel-efficient vehicle and avoiding financing. Consider whether you would be willing to give up your current, expensive car in exchange for retiring years earlier, possibly up to ten years earlier."}

{"370": "\n\nDisclaimer: Although I work in life insurance, I am not an agent. In order to give an accurate answer regarding life insurance, more information is required. Critical considerations include the policy values and the terms and conditions of the contract. For instance, people tend to discuss market projections, such as an annual compounded rate of growth of 7-8%; however, historical stock market returns differ from these projections. On the other hand, life insurance policies provide a guaranteed return (as shown in the \"Guaranteed\" section of the life insurance illustration), which accrues as long as premiums are paid. Additionally, insurance providers also show \"Non-Guaranteed\" elements (based on a scale at a specific time period) that depict how cash value might grow when dividends are credited to a policy. It's important to note that life insurance policies often have preferential tax treatment, making them attractive to beneficiaries. Also, death benefits are tax-free for beneficiaries, and the strategy behind a policy will impact the decision to transfer or accrue wealth. Therefore, it's not possible to provide an answer without more information. However, it's concerning that some people label whole life insurance as a scam without sufficient consideration. Depending on the age and purpose, whole life insurance policies can provide viable options. In general, those looking to accrue wealth should opt for investments in the market and consider term life insurance for a death benefit component. Yet, for a 25-year-old with specific purposes, whole life insurance might be a good option."}

{"375": "\n\nRevised: Economic indicators, such as rising interest rates, are commonplace in all economic and business cycles. However, a more reliable strategy is to observe price trends. An uptrend is evidenced by successive higher lows and higher highs, while a downtrend is characterized by lower lows and lower highs. For long-term investments, examining weekly or even monthly charts spanning 10, 15 or 20 years can be beneficial. Using the S&P500 as an example, if prices continue to trend upwards, stay invested. A lower high than the previous high serves as a warning sign of a potential end to the uptrend but is not conclusive. If prices follow this with higher lows and higher highs, the trend is unaffected. A lower low after the lower high indicates the uptrend is over, prompting an exit from the market. If a lower low follows a higher high, it is advisable to wait for confirmation that the uptrend is over with a lower high. If individual shares are invested in, monitoring both the market and individual share charts is advisable, with exit points planned if their trends are broken. Employing stop losses can be beneficial in managing individual share risk if the trend reverses on the index. Buying back into the market when the downtrend breaks and prices indicate higher highs and higher lows is advisable. While uptrends may reverse and start trending up again after a short period, it is better to pay extra brokerage and some capital gains tax than to have portfolios drop over 50%, taking five or more years to recover. It is crucial for investors to conserve and protect capital, and profits, in the long run. Paying tax is a sign of making profits, making it a good thing. Avoiding tax, on the other hand, means foregoing profits in the future."}
{"376": "\n\nInterest rates are primarily determined by individuals' time preference for money and the things money can buy. People with a high time preference value immediate access to cash over money promised in the future. Therefore, they only lend money if they are offered an incentive, represented by the interest rate that is higher than the amount of money lent. Various factors determine an individual's time preference, such as the borrower's credit rating, loan length, their demand for cash, and their expectation of currency value changes.\n\nIn general, a lender's first loan has a lower interest rate than their last, assuming all factors are constant. The decline in cash supply with each loan increases the remaining cash's value and raises the interest rate required to make additional loans.\n\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) impacts interest rates in two ways. Firstly, by printing new money used to purchase government bonds, thus keeping demand for these bonds high and subsequently, lowering their yield. Secondly, the Fed can provide cartel member banks with an unlimited amount of funds at the Federal Funds rate, allowing the bank to make loans at higher rates and pocket the difference. However, other bond holders such as foreign governments and pension funds can demand higher rates, which will affect the Fed's control over interest rates. If the Fed tries to keep rates low, it may lead to people dumping dollars as they realize the Fed is printing money for the government. In conclusion, although the Fed plays a significant role in interest rate determination, it is not the only market participant, and various factors influence it."}

{"380": "\n\nI believe confirmation bias may be influencing the perspective presented here. When speaking with someone who has successfully launched a profitable business, they may suggest that the process is straightforward by describing the steps they took to achieve their success. However, this viewpoint overlooks the countless entrepreneurs who have followed the same path but have yet to break even, earn substantially less, or have gone bankrupt and moved on. It is unlikely that you will hear about these individuals, as books or articles detailing failed start-up attempts typically sell poorly when compared to accounts of success. Therefore, the notion of an easy way to launch a business is unlikely, as there would be significantly more millionaires. Nevertheless, this does not mean that one should not attempt to launch a business. The success rate for launching ventures, while not 100%, is greater than the rate of not trying anything at all.

In contrast, Betterment is a robo-advisor that uses algorithms and web pages to provide financial advice, likely at a lower cost than Edward Jones. They focus on cheaper funds like index funds and ETFs. Vanguard, on the other hand, is a discount broker and mutual fund family. They offer some assistance and advice, but do not charge fees and are not in the business of providing personalized advice. If you are willing to learn a bit of finance and manage your own affairs, Vanguard (or a competitor like Fidelity) will likely result in the most wealth generated.

In our country, many people have a disproportionately large portion of their net worth tied up in their homes, which is reflective of poor saving habits more than anything else. In my case, having a substantial amount of equity enables me to sell my current property and downsize to a smaller, less expensive home with cash. Being older, my primary objective (along with my spouse) is to pay off the house and fully fund our child's college education before retiring.

In terms of accounting, a bank account is considered a current asset and falls under the category of Real accounts. Debits represent what enters the business while credits represent what exits it. The distinction between debit and credit depends on the account type. For example, liabilities are typically recorded as credits while assets and receivables are recorded as debits."}
{"393": "\n\nThere are several types of mortgage insurance (MI) to choose from, including Borrower-Paid Monthly (the most common), Borrower-Paid Single Premium (which may have QM issues), Lender-Paid Single Premium, and Split Up-Front and Monthly. To determine which option will cost you less in the long run, estimate how long you plan to keep the mortgage and compare the costs of each option over that time. Adding a single-premium to your loan is unlikely to happen outside of FHA/VA, as it could raise your financing to 90%+ and change your pricing bracket or disqualify you altogether. Instead, premium pricing is often used to pay the up-front premium. This means taking a lender credit for an elevated interest rate, which is the opposite of paying points to lower the rate. For example, if a zero-point rate is 4.25% and monthly MI is 0.8%, the effective rate would be 5.05%. But by using premium pricing at an elevated rate of 4.75% to pay your MI up front, your new effective rate would be the note rate of 4.75%, potentially saving you money. However, keep in mind that the higher rate will be in effect for the life of the loan. Knowing your estimated length of financing is critical to making the best choice."}
{"394": "\n\nRevised: Investing in the stock market requires caution and knowledge. While the Dow has shown a 7% annual gain since 1915 when adjusted for inflation, caution is necessary due to market fluctuations. Between 1966 and 1982, the Dow lost 73% of its inflation-adjusted value, resulting in a 4.5% annual loss for 16 years. It is important to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. Although similar market trends may occur over the next 60 years, there is no guarantee that stocks will increase in value when needed. Funds also require management fees, resulting in losses that offset potential gains. Rather than blindly investing, it is important to evaluate companies and assess their potential for growth based on probability. Rather than gambling, safe investments such as treasury bonds, although with lower returns, may provide investors with peace of mind."}
{"395": "\n\nInvesting in only two securities is generally not recommended in order to diversify risk. While the VTI provides exposure to a large number of securities, its goal of reducing portfolio beta to zero is not entirely achieved, as its current beta is 1.03 as of today's closing in New York. This means that VTI moves in near-perfect correlation with \"the market,\" usually benchmarked against the S&P 500, making it slightly more volatile than that index. A beta of 0 would be achieved by investing in T-bills, which are generally considered a risk-free rate. Thus, it is possible to reduce portfolio risk and implement a more capital-protective strategy. I hope this information is helpful."}
{"396": "\n\nIf you have multiple assets available along with a risk-free asset, blending them is the best course of action, assuming you have a reasonable objective. However, in your case, you seem to have limited yourself to a 100% investment, coupled with only considering two assets. This could result in a portfolio where only one asset is chosen, especially if you view one as dominating the other. Although diversification generally benefits a portfolio, this may not be the case for you, given that both funds are already highly diversified. Choosing more than one fund merely adds cross-border diversification, which may explain your results. While portfolio theory can guide your intuition, the accuracy of your expected return vector and covariance matrix is critical. These inputs significantly impact portfolio results, so many investors rely on their instincts rather than resorting to mathematical models. More sophisticated models are often unnecessary as they do not necessarily generate a more reasonable outcome. Therefore, your initial strategy of an 80-20 split sounds reasonable. You might want to diversify outside of equities, but you likely have valid reasons for not doing so."}

{"398": "\n\nAgree with mhoran_psprep. I'm not certain of your inquiry, but let me break down how banks acquire and distribute their funds. When a bank opens, the founders usually seek investors, offering personal connections or stock to raise the initial capital. Depositors contribute most of the money to the bank. Essentially, banks take funds from depositors and provide loans to borrowers. Besides this, banks borrow money from other banks or the government. They charge borrowers interest and pay depositors interest on their accounts. The difference between these rates is where banks generate their profit. \n\nConcerning repayment, some of the money goes towards paying depositors' interests, while some cover bank expenses like salaries, maintenance, and other overhead costs. The remainder goes as profit to the bank owners or stockholders. If you seem to be paying more than you borrowed, this is because banks lend money for long repayment periods, like 20-30 years, and earn only around 4-5% interest annually in the United States. I'm unsure of the rates elsewhere."}

Keep in mind that most people in the Northeast do not drive all-wheel-drive vehicles and all cars have all-wheel brakes. All-wheel drive primarily aids in getting the car moving from a stop if one of the drive wheels would otherwise be slipping but makes less of a difference during actual driving. Traction control braking is more crucial and is commonly included in vehicles, such as in a Camry. Good tires, particularly top-of-the-line all-season tires or snow tires, can make a significant difference in driving in winter conditions. Buying a set of tires, along with rims if necessary, is considerably cheaper than purchasing a new car. Ultimately, safe driving in snowy conditions requires careful practice, such as avoiding sudden starts, stops, or turns, limiting arcade-like driving and practicing handling skids. Waiting until roads have been plowed and salted is recommended if uncertain about driving conditions. Teenagers can learn to drive in these conditions, which indicates it is possible for anyone to do so. Consider if a new car is truly necessary before making any purchases."}

Additionally, student loans do not negatively impact one's credit but will be taken into consideration when applying for new credit. My advice differs from the previous information - if you own shares that have lost more than 10% of their value and do not show signs of recovery, it might be wise to sell them to pay off debts. The decision to sell the remaining shares should be based on whether they are earning more than 10% per year or if dividends can cover the loan repayments.

Typically, I observe the order books adapting to my order, which leads me to believe that the order book primarily comprises of market makers. Upon spotting a retail investor like myself entering the transaction realm, the market makers withdraw their interest from the illiquid option, leading other traders to execute their market orders. Consequently, this allows me to proceed with my transaction as I momentarily become a market maker. In highly liquid options, purchase limits at the bid face difficulty as the market makers work the spread. However, with insignificant orders of one or two contracts on highly liquid options, I have often received quick fills in the middle of the spread. I attribute this to market makers rebalancing their stocks inexpensively. Though at times, I ponder if there are other traders like me out there, who cannot bear to witness a lopsided book. I have not noticed this occurrence happening more with puts or calls, or with buy vs sell transactions.

{"407": "There are many factors that can impact the pricing of gasoline. One of the primary factors is the brand name. Major brand gas typically costs more than discount brand gas, as major brands often have proprietary detergents and cleaning agents, stricter requirements for tank maintenance, and lower ethanol content. It's important to note that all gasolines are not created equal, despite the common misconception that they are. To save on costs, some people may opt for the cheaper gas, but this can lead to engine damage and other issues.\n\nMarket price is another factor that can significantly impact gas pricing. Gas prices at the pump tend to rise quickly when the market price of crude or gasoline goes up, and then fall more slowly than the market price due to the slim margins on gas sales. Gas stations may increase prices to match market prices, but gradually lower them over time to mitigate losses.\n\nOverhead costs, such as land and property taxes, can also affect gas prices. Nicer, newer stations tend to have higher operating costs, which can result in higher gas prices. State and federal taxes on gasoline can also play a role in pricing, with some states having higher gas taxes than others.\n\nProximity to other gas stations can also influence pricing. Gas stations may need to stay within a penny of their competitors' prices to remain competitive. Predatory pricing, which is taking a loss on sales in one area to drive out competition, is technically illegal but can still be seen in the C-store industry.\n\nPopulation distribution is another factor that can impact gas pricing. In areas with high population densities, there is greater competition for customer dollars, which can result in higher prices. Conversely, in rural areas with few gas stations, prices may be more competitive, but prices can still be high due to limited options and transportation costs.\n\nTransportation costs can also impact gas prices, with the bulk of the U.S. refinery capacity located along the Gulf Coast. As a result, gas prices tend to be higher on the East and West Coasts, as it costs more to transport fuel from the Gulf states to these areas. Tanker imports from foreign sources can sometimes be cheaper than transporting gas via limited pipelines."}
{"408": "\n\nMany states have a straightforward approach for calculating income tax for nonresidents. If you have earned $X income in State A and claim nonresident status, and you have earned a total of $Y income, then you owe State A a proportion (X/Y) of the income tax that would have been due on $Y income if you were a resident of State A. In other words, calculate the state income tax on $Y under State A rules and remit (X/Y) of that amount to State A. If you are a State B resident, State B will tax you on $Y but provide some credit for taxes paid to State A. Hence, you may be required to file a State A income tax return regardless of how insignificant $X is.\n\nIn practice, several commercial real estate investments are established as limited partnerships in which the bulk of the yearly taxable income is portfolio interest income (reported on Schedule B of Form 1040), and passive losses are reported on the Federal return by limited partners (but not deducted). Consequently, State A is unlikely to pursue payment of taxes on, say, $100 of interest income annually because it is more expensive than what it can recover from you. However, when the property is sold, there could be a considerable capital gain, most of which will be exempt from federal taxes because passive losses are ultimately included as deductions. At that moment, State A will be owed substantial sums (not considering passive losses), and it may require you to file income tax returns for previous years after processing the income tax return for that year."}

However, as you approach retirement in 20 years, it may be wise to divide your savings into two lumps with different risk levels. For instance, one lump of money for ages 55-70 with lower risk, and another for when you reach age 80. This will allow you to wait until age 70 to receive the maximum monthly Social Security benefits.

{"410": "In order to understand the answer, we must first comprehend the concept of Goodwill. As an intangible asset on a company's balance sheet, Goodwill represents the extra value provided by a strong brand name, good customer and employee relations, as well as any patents or proprietary technology. An article from The Economist aptly explains this and even cites Time Warner as an example. When one company acquires another, the acquired company's Goodwill- or the premium paid over its book value- is added to the combined entity's balance sheet. According to Goldman Sachs analysts, the total value of Goodwill and other intangibles on the books of companies in the S&P 500 amounts to $2.6 trillion, which represents 10% of their total assets. As the economy worsens, and more firms trade below or towards book value, asset values that were previously marked up may now be adjusted. Time Warner is faced with a $25 billion Goodwill charge, which is expected to result in an operating loss for 2008. Michael Moran of Goldman Sachs predicts that such hits could amount to $200 billion or more over the cycle. As write-downs become more prevalent, investors may become more wary of industries with a high ratio of Goodwill to assets, such as healthcare, consumer goods, and telecommunications. The impact of these write-downs on companies depends on the accountants. Prior to 2002, American firms were permitted to amortize Goodwill over many years, but an accounting-rule change ended that practice. Nowadays, Goodwill must be tested annually for impairment. During this turbulent time, with auditors working to avoid being seen as lenient, companies are being urged to mark down assets if there are any doubts about their worth. Although write-downs do not affect cashflow since they are non-cash items, they do reduce overall book values and increase leverage ratios. This could be a significant concern given current debt-averse times. The larger companies are better equipped to survive such setbacks, as evidenced by the $99 billion loss that AOL Time Warner recorded in 2002. Investors may choose to take Goodwill write-offs with a grain of salt, preferring to look beyond these non-recurring costs and rely instead on higher \"normalised\" earnings figures, which managers understandably focus on."}

Fundamental analysis involves analyzing financial statements, management, competitors, and markets. When applied to futures and forex, it focuses on the economy, interest rates, production, earnings, and management. Technical analysis, on the other hand, uses past market data to forecast future prices, and is a method of active management. Both technical and fundamental analyses are disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis, which postulates that stock market prices are unpredictable. To avoid losing money aimlessly, different types of trading strategies exist, such as day trading, trend following, and market making. Before investing, research which strategy you want to use.

Salary is the most obvious, referring to what the company pays for your work. Taxes are also a significant cost to employers, covering social security for retirement, unemployment insurance in case of layoffs, and workers' compensation for job-related injuries, among others. Benefits, such as medical insurance, retirement plans, and holiday pay, are also provided by many companies to their employees. Finally, capital, including equipment and furniture, is often required for an employee to perform their job duties. These factors make up the total cost of employing someone. \n\nIn the case of hiring a foreign employee, taxes may differ, but the overall cost should be similar if the same benefits and capital investment are provided. A domestic employee may cost a company $60,000 in salary and $20,000 in taxes, but if a foreign employee has no tax costs, the amount paid should logically be $80,000. Accounting professionals in larger companies calculate the cost of new employees in detail, while smaller companies may not. \n\nOther considerations for hiring foreign remote employees include potential language barriers, communication difficulties, time zone differences, and bureaucratic complexities. These issues can create inefficiencies and challenges for both the employee and the employer. \n\nUltimately, negotiations are necessary to determine the best offer for both parties.

When deciding which stocks to buy, I have a set of criteria that I follow, and I'll use SBUX as an example. Firstly, I make sure that I understand what the company does, which is often summarized as \"buy what you know.\" I look for businesses that are profitable and have steady growth, and I find that this doesn't necessarily need to be a complicated process. For example, with SBUX, my decision-making process started inside one of their stores. I saw a long line-up of people willing to pay a premium for their coffee and thought to myself, \"I wonder if this is a good stock to buy?\"\n\nNext, I evaluate the fundamentals of the company to determine if it's a good investment. Metrics such as the price-to-earnings (P.E.) ratio, book value, and price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) are helpful indicators of stock pricing. I compare these values to others in the industry to get an idea if the stock is overpriced or not. SBUX currently has a P.E. ratio of roughly 30, which seems average compared to competitors such as PEP, KKD, and GMCR. This seems like a good sign.\n\nAdditionally, I consider if the company pays a dividend, which is neither positive nor negative, but useful to know. I tend to favor dividend-paying stocks, even if it means sacrificing more aggressive growth. A company that pays a dividend is usually confident in its ability to generate cash and turn a profit, so it instills more confidence in me about the safety of the investment. Fortunately, SBUX pays a small dividend, which is a positive factor for me.\n\nLastly, I decide if I'm willing to keep an eye on the stock. With index funds, I tend to make a purchase and forget about it. However, individual stocks require more attention and regular monitoring. In SBUX's case, I don't need to keep a close watch on it, but I do try to stay up-to-date with the latest news surrounding the company.\n\nOverall, my decision to invest in SBUX meets all of my criteria, which means I feel comfortable making this investment.

{"429": "\n\nYes, in a way. Within Yahoo Finance, there is a particular view that allows you to observe a stock's price movement. For example, suppose you were to make a market order for 3000 shares of a particular stock, which is not even worth $4000 - this would still cause the stock to move past $1.34, which represents a more than 3% price increase. Now, let's assume that the Ask side currently has 100,000 shares, each with a $10 ask price. Since it would take numerous orders to purchase all of these shares, the price might remain stable at $10 or go down slightly if there are individuals willing to sell at a lower price. However, if the Ask side showed $10 for 1000 shares, $10.25 for 500 shares, and $10.50 for 1000 shares, the volume is low enough that a market order from you would cause the market price to increase up to $10.50 if you purchased 2500 shares at market price. Even though you are a small trader, your order raised the price. Once you go to sell all 2500 shares at $10.50, there might not be any bids to buy at that price, so there's no way to know what the next trade's price will be. There could be bids at $10, and you might ask $10.50, causing no trades to occur until the seller agrees to sell at the $10 bid price or other traders come in with varying offers."}

{"435": "\n\nA call or put option entitles you to buy (call) or sell (put) shares at a specific price on a particular date. The range of prices on the chart represents only a selection of possible stock values, with the number of options limited to maintain reasonability. Typically, options represent even units, but for high-priced stocks, the intervals may be even more extensive. The chart indicates June, specifically the third Friday of the month, which falls on June 15th in this case. These options speculate how the stock will move within the next ten days, and while the figures are per share, options are traded only in lots of 100. The calls are listed on the left side of the chart. If you sell a call option at 19, you would have received a premium of 9.70 per share for the last traded option. However, towards the expiry date, the trade value can fluctuate depending on the market factors. For instance, if the market value of the stock at the expiry date drops below 19, you will receive the stock while the other party must pay you the purchase price. Conversely, if the stock price rises to more than 26, you cannot back out and have to trade your shares. \n\nOn the right side of the chart is the puts section. It is the reverse of the calls in that the holder has the option to sell the shares to you at a strike price come the expiry date. For instance, at a strike price of 30, you would collect 3.20$ for agreeing to buy shares per put option sold. If the market price of the share at the expiry date is less than the strike price, you must purchase the shares. Still, if it trades higher than the strike price, the option becomes worthless. You usually need to have shares in question to sell call options, as the selling of options without owning the stock is risky. Because of the potential loss, your broker may prohibit margin trades in options. The risk is infinite when selling a call without owning shares, potentially costing many times the original investment when the market price fluctuates. If the number of shares sold is more than the stocks available for holding, catastrophic possibilities may arise, where the holder determines the trade's terms. (This used to happen in the past.)"}

{"437": "\n\nPossible revision:\n\nDread disease policies, also known as critical illness insurance, are typically not a wise choice due to adverse selection and asymmetric information. When you buy an insurance policy, the insurer estimates your risk level and sets the premium accordingly. Asymmetric information arises when you possess information about your risk level that the insurer does not have. For instance, you may appear low-risk on paper but engage in high-risk activities that increase your health expenses. In contrast, adverse selection occurs when people with higher risk levels are more likely to buy insurance, as they have a greater need for coverage. Dread disease policies allow you to specify a disease you wish to insure against, revealing information to the insurer about your higher-than-average risk of that ailment. As a result, these policies often cost more and may not renew if your risk level becomes too high. With the Affordable Care Act, all new health insurance plans must provide essential health benefits, meaning that dread disease policies may no longer be available. Additionally, the law prohibits lifetime limits on most health plans, reducing the need for specific disease coverage. Instead of buying a dread disease policy, you should evaluate the services, choice of providers, and costs of comprehensive health insurance plans, such as catastrophic coverage with a high deductible."}

Decreasing your available credit will also make your current debt appear higher, potentially causing lenders to perceive you as a higher risk. This is particularly significant if your debt to available credit ratio exceeds a certain percentage. \n\nIt's crucial to note, however, that closing a credit card will not affect the average age of all your credit cards.

This process involves borrowing shares from your broker (e.g. eTrade) without paying for them, then selling them to receive money that is transferred to your account. However, you do not own the shares and must return them to your broker at a later date. Suppose you borrow 10 shares at $100 each and sell them at market price to receive $1,000 in your account. You owe your broker 10 shares, and if the price drops to $80 a few days later, you can buy 10 shares for a total cost of $800.

This borrowing is typically done over phone and fax, with the lending bank sending a high-value transaction that credits the borrowing bank. Managing liquidity is the day-to-day job of the treasury group, who are highly paid individuals.

Lowering the price gradually is a good tactic, and doing so repeatedly won't harm your chances of selling. Keep in mind that pricing it too high might discourage potential buyers from making an offer, so aim for something reasonable for the neighborhood.\n\nIf you have the luxury of time, keep lowering the price until you find the right buyer.

If the demand for both exceeds the supply, the farmer would benefit more by planting the former. However, if claims that HFCS contributes to obesity are valid, then society would be better off with less of it and more alternative foods. Since no one would voluntarily reduce production, subsidies provide monetary incentives to facilitate change.

Take, for example, a 12-unit apartment building with paying tenants. If several tenants move out, the building stops generating revenue and becomes a financial burden for the estate. In such a scenario, a property management company would step in to find new tenants to keep the revenue flowing. The same logic applies to other assets, such as a house. Some argue against renting out a house, citing concerns about potential damage or liability. However, allowing a house to sit abandoned can lead to far worse outcomes, such as squatters or damage from the elements. Renting out a house brings in money that can cover the costs of maintenance, repairs, and other expenses, which ultimately benefits the estate and its beneficiaries.

If this happens, the Bank of England may raise interest rates, in line with its historical practice of hedging against inflation. \n\nWith interest rates already artificially low since the 2008 global crash, they cannot remain at the same level if inflation rises. This, in turn, would lead to higher mortgage rates. For instance, a \u00a3100k mortgage at a present interest rate of 3.92% currently costs \u00a3523 per month. With a 7% rate, repayments go up to \u00a3707 per month, and at 10%, it becomes \u00a3909 per month, and so on. A mortgage calculator like the one found at https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/mortgage-rate-calculator can help you estimate your potential mortgage payments. \n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to strive for a small mortgage that you can afford should interest rates rise significantly.

Only certain banks and organizations have access to these systems, such as clearing banks and BACS. CHAPS is a fast but costly method, while BACS batches transfers to reduce costs but can take longer. Checks must be in place to prevent fraud, and foreign currency transfers require mediation by at least one clearing bank in the relevant country. Fast payments can be made through BACS, but for safety reasons, there are limits on the amount that can be transferred.

{"473": "\n\nThis is my understanding of the concept of Fibonacci numbers, levels, ratios, and percentages. It is based on the idea of sequential increments. You can find lots of information about Fibonacci online. In the stock market, this concept is used to predict psychological levels. When a trend forms, prices tend to accumulate or consolidate at these levels. The impact of percentages and ratios can be seen by checking any long trend. To do this, draw a Fibonacci retracement from the immediate previous high and connect it to its low. This will show new levels of intermediate trend. In the broader term, after a reversal, a leg (trend) forms, followed by a body and then a head, which is smaller. When the first leg that forms refuses to break 23.6% or 38.2%, then the previous trend may continue. The 50% level is usually an indecision phase. Even though the 61.8% level is seen as indecision, it is a crucial level as it is the breakout level towards 100%. If the stock retraces 100%, it is a sign that a new big trend is forming. For day traders, levels of 23.6%, 38.2%, and 50% are very crucial from a trading perspective. This concept is so realistic that every level is considered and respected. Suppose a candle or bar starts at the 23.6% level, crosses 38.2% and directly hits 50%. In that case, the next candle or bar will revert and hit 38.2% before continuing with the trend. This means that the price comes back, forms its area at this level, and then moves in whichever direction the force directs it. It is important to note that one cannot trade Fibonacci alone and needs the help of oscillators or other tools to confirm it."}

Every hard inquiry on your credit report temporarily affects your score, except in the case of mortgage funding. For up to 30 days while shopping for a mortgage, additional inquiries won't count against you. However, it's only for mortgage-related inquiries and not for other forms of credit.

However, trading continuously is not feasible, and so replicating the stock return is not possible. This may create an illusion of arbitrage profits, with puts appearing unusually expensive.

{"495": "\n\nGreat job on your math skills! In theory, your proposal should work out well because the math checks out. However, have you studied economics or finance? The math used in those classes can make even the most skilled mathematicians uncomfortable due to the level of imprecision involved, even if they are comfortable with chaos theory. Personal finance can be even more challenging. If it were simply a matter of math, products like reverse mortgages, payday lenders, and advances on income tax returns would not exist. The risk involved in your proposal is largely behavioral, which can be beyond the control of the person attempting the scheme. There are many unforeseen circumstances that could arise. In my opinion, the market is risky enough even without borrowing money to invest. It's one thing to not pay extra principle on a mortgage in order to invest in the market, but your proposal is a different story. While there may be late fees associated with a mortgage payment, a fixed-rate mortgage will not change if you are late on payments. Conversely, with balance transfer credit card schemes, they can jack up your rate for any reason possible. I read an article that the most common way to end up with a credit card rate of over 23% is to start with a 0% balance transfer rate. Additionally, the transfer fee paid for these schemes can significantly increase the stated rate of the credit card. Ultimately, becoming debt-free, building an emergency fund, and then investing is the best approach. Building a solid financial foundation will make it much easier to make progress. With a proper foundation, your net worth will increase far more quickly than you may have ever thought possible."}

However, various options are emerging for this specific scheme, such as the UK Government's \"Help to Buy\" initiative. Under this initiative, accommodation is offered at a regular rate, and a small portion of rent is saved each month towards a deposit for a mortgage. This deposit is handed over to a mortgage provider at the end of a fixed term period. It's possible that the confusion lies in terminology, as the scenario that others have described could fall under the same name you've used. \n\nThe other scenario involves an investor who owns a property and may consider selling it. They may be happy to negotiate the price upfront for the following year, setting the rent and price higher than the market rate because of the risk of loss should the market improve. During that year, they gain about $1,000 per month but investing $100,000 would provide a return of 12%, or just 4.8% if the property's value is over $250,000, which is more likely. This isn't a bad rate, but considering maintenance and other factors, they may still be losing potential profits. Should the market improve, however, the investor would suffer a loss, since renting the property at 15% below the market value equates to a 10.2% total loss.\n\nIt's essential to review the terms before signing any agreements.

Microsoft might benefit from building a solid credit reputation, as this can garner familiarity among investors, leading to the purchase of their bonds at lower rates when borrowing larger sums.

{"500": "\n\n\nRevised:\n\nYour post has various questions, but I will focus only on how to value the ESPP. When valuing this option, it is important to consider what the market would charge you for it today, rather than what you might sell the shares for in the future. In general, an option is worth much less than the underlying share itself. \n\nFor instance, if you work at a public company, and your exercise price for the options is $.30, and you can only exercise those options until the end of today, and the cost of the shares on the public stock exchange is also $.30, then your option is worth nothing, as you have the same 'strike price' as everyone else in the market. However, having the right to a specific strike price gives you value, which means you can take advantage of the upside in share price gains without risking any money on share losses. \n\nTo value the options, if it is a public company with an active options market, you can compare your $.30 strike price with the value of call options in the market that have a $.30 strike price. That becomes the value to you of the option. Though finding an exact match for the terms of your vesting period is unlikely, this should give you a good starting point. \n\nIn a public company without an active options market, you will need to do some estimation. For example, if a current share is worth $.25 (close to your strike price), then your option is worth only a little bit. You can compare other shares in your industry/company size to get examples that show the relative value between an option and a share. If the current share price is worth $.35, then your option is worth about $.05 (that is, the $.05 profit you could get by immediately exercising and selling, plus a bit more for an option on a share that you can't buy in the open market). \n\nIn the case of a private company, you need to be clear on how shares are valued and what methods you have available to sell back to the company/other individuals. You can then consider, as explained above, how to value the option for a share versus the share itself. The value of a small number of shares is, however, very nebulous without a clear way to sell your shares of a private company. \n\nGiven the valuation of $2/share (while ensuring these are the same share classes you have the option to buy), your option would be worth a little more than $1.70 if you did not have to wait 4 years to exercise it. This would mean total compensation of approximately $10k if you were to exercise it today. However, as many people do not work for an early job for as long as 4 years, you should consider how much this will reduce the value of the ESPP for you personally. This compensation may not necessarily be a motivating factor, particularly when compared to a salary of 90k. Note that the valuation of $2/share of the private company should be taken with a grain of salt since the company is not public."}

An option series consists of a combination of underlying symbol, expiration date, and option type (call/put), such as all January 2015 XYZ calls for a particular strike. \n\nTo illustrate, if stock XYZ is currently trading at $11 and the available January 2015 XYZ calls have strike prices of $6, $8, $10, $12, $14, and $16, then the $10 call would be considered one strike in the money, the $8 call would be two strikes in the money, and so on. The $12 and $14 calls would be considered one and two strikes out of the money, respectively. \n\nHowever, this measurement is relative to both the current underlying price (which changes quickly) and the strike prices available for the given option series. As a software developer, I find it imprecise and would recommend specifying contract strikes in dollar terms when it matters. This terminology may have arisen due to the frequent use of options that are at- or near-the-money in various option strategies. Nonetheless, I suggest avoiding it and using specific examples to describe strategies accurately."}

{"519": "\n\nWhy are home loans cheaper than gold loans? The answer lies in the level of risk. When an individual borrows money that is secured by gold, the lender has to take on extra risk. As a result, the lender passes on the cost to the borrower in the form of higher interest rates. This is why home loans are cheaper compared to other types of loans. These loans are secured by a property, which is an asset that usually holds its value. Properties are easily traceable, unlike gold which can be hidden or moved. Furthermore, properties can be sold off in order to pay off a loan that is in default. This makes them relatively liquid assets."}

Additional information on this topic can be found in the Globe & Mail's Report on Business site and the Service Canada web site. The Work-Sharing Applicant Guide confirms that any earnings received in excess of 40% or $75 (whichever is greater) of the participant's weekly benefit rate from sources other than Work-Sharing employment will be deducted from the Work-Sharing benefits payable in that week.

It's unclear whether they have investments or not and whether they want advice on which securities to purchase or overall financial planning, such as savings, insurance, tax-shelters, retirement planning, and mortgages. These require a different skill set from accountants who specialize in operating business reporting, taxes, and keeping businesses healthy and growing. Although accountants can do personal tax returns, they may not be experts in financial planning and optimization.

For instance, a large public company that contracts with a smaller supplier or service company, which is also public, may offer a tender below the market price. This may cause the market to question the relationship between the two companies and speculate on whether the larger company has information about the smaller one that the public is unaware of. \n\nHowever, when investors lose confidence in a stock, they tend to sell, causing a rise in supply, a decrease in demand, and subsequently, a drop in the share price. The company making the tender offer may then acquire shares via the offer or the open market. Nonetheless, this strategy is usually short-lived and successful only when the company is a dominant player who can impose their terms on other parties. Additionally, these offers are closely scrutinized by the SEC, and if the larger company is found to be engaging in predatory behavior, or if its management is exploiting insider information for personal gain, the approach may backfire with the company becoming the subject of legal action by the SEC or DOJ."}
{"528": "\n\nManaging your finances on a daily basis can be unnecessarily complicated. Unless you're living paycheck to paycheck, constantly asking yourself if you can afford your basic needs can be overwhelming. To simplify things, start by creating a list of your bills. This includes both fixed monthly payments like your mortgage and variable expenses like your electric bill. For bills that come less frequently, like a quarterly water bill or twice yearly property taxes, calculate what you need to set aside each month. Be sure to round up or give a little extra cushion for unexpected expenses. \n\nWhile groceries may be more difficult to budget for, it's important to track your spending for a few months to determine an average monthly cost. Also allocate a portion of your income towards savings and charitable contributions each month. Once you have a clear idea of your monthly expenses, subtract that from your income to determine your spending money. \n\nTo keep things organized, pay your bills twice a month when you get paid. Keep enough money in your checking account to cover your monthly expenses, plus a cushion for any errors or surprises. If done correctly, you should have enough money to cover your bills and spending without worrying about your balance on a daily basis. \n\nTo easily track your spending money, simply subtract your bills and credit card balances, then subtract your reserve amount. This leaves you with the amount you have available to spend. It's important to limit the number of credit cards you have to avoid confusion and keep balances under control. Using a spreadsheet to plan your monthly spending can be helpful, but trust your actual account balance for accuracy. With a clear budget and some financial discipline, managing your money can be a lot simpler than it seems."}

{"533": "\n\nThe returns of over 20% in mutual funds are not a free lunch; they represent compensation for the associated risk. Given the surge in returns, it's fair to assume that there is significant risk involved, leading to a higher chance of substantial losses in the future. Putting substantial funds into these mutual funds involves a gamble that might or might not pay off. Assuming that your friend pays you a reasonable rent, you are not losing money regarding the market. You are earning less because you have invested in a less risky asset. However, if you seek higher returns, you could consider selling your home or borrowing money to invest in the market, where you might make more significant profits. But remember, high-risk ventures come with a higher chance of substantial losses, and no one can promise a 20% return on such investments. A wise approach to investing is to diversify your portfolio, including stocks, bonds, and real estate. If you want to minimize risk and are willing to receive lower returns, put more money into safe assets. However, if you are willing to take greater risks for the possibility of higher returns, move more assets into riskier investments. Suppose you are comfortable taking on extreme risks in search of extreme returns. In that case, you might want to consider borrowing money to invest in high-risk ventures. Remember that anything promising high returns most likely carries high risk as well."}
{"534": "I'm up for the challenge. Before diving in, it's important to ask two separate, yet related questions: how trustworthy are these sites, and what are their sources of income? A trustworthy site will be transparent about how they generate revenue. If you can't find any information on their payment methods or why they're paying you, it's probably best to walk away. As the saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Ads and surveys are common sources of income for these sites, with some offering gift cards or airline miles as compensation. While they won't replace a full-time income, they can be a useful way to earn extra cash.\n\nWhen it comes to taxes, most of these sites pay out low amounts in non-cash compensation, such as gift cards. Technically, this income should be reported on your tax return under hobby income, but it's unlikely the IRS will come after you for failing to do so. If you're earning significant amounts (more than $20-30 a year), it's best to keep track of expenses and report it as business income on your taxes.\n\nTo determine whether a site is a scam, keep your eyes peeled for red flags. If they're asking for personal or financial information without adequate explanation, that's a sign to walk away. Check internet reviews, BBB ratings, FTC information, and other relevant sources to see if there's any negative information about the site. Contact information is also crucial - if they don't have a phone number or a physical address, move along. Finally, trust your instincts. If it feels like a scam, it probably is."}

In terms of tax efficiency, ETFs generally outperform their equivalent mutual funds, though the extent of the advantage would vary depending on the specific fund and ETF being evaluated.

As of 2015, the maximum annual contribution is $5,500, while those over age 50 may contribute up to $6,500. Additionally, your IRA contribution cannot exceed your total earned income.

{"537": "\n\nRevised:\n\nTo contribute to a Traditional IRA, you must have compensation, and the contribution limit is the smaller of your compensation or $5500 ($6000 for those aged 50 or older). Additionally, compensation includes earnings from self-employment, commissions, alimony, and other sources (excluding income from property, pensions, certain partnerships, and annuities). However, you cannot contribute if you are 70.5 years or older in the year of contribution. If you do not have compensation, but your spouse does, you can still contribute as long as you file a joint tax return. The contribution limit remains the same, and the total contributions for both spouses must not exceed their total earned income. Note, these rules do not apply to whether the contribution is deductible. If you meet the above requirements, you are eligible to make contributions, but the deduction amount depends on your income. High incomes may not be eligible for a deduction. Unlike Traditional IRAs, high-income earners cannot contribute to Roth IRAs. Lastly, the source of cash for the contribution does not matter. You do not have to prove that the contributed cash came from compensation. For further information, refer to Publication 590, available at www.irs.gov."}
{"538": "\n\nAlthough it typically requires a significant amount of capital, there are opportunities for seed funding and angel investments in startups that don't involve venture capital.

If you're interested, Paul Graham of Y-Combinator has written several articles discussing this investment approach from both perspectives. However, it's critical to note that investing in startups is a high-risk endeavor, albeit with the potential for significant returns if you can identify successful startups, acquire equity, and help them succeed. This type of investment is far from hands-off; you'll need to build connections within the startup community and may become personally involved in the day-to-day operations of the businesses in which you invest."}

{"543": "\n\nA bullish or long call spread involves two separate option trades, with strike prices denoted as A/B. The first leg, corresponding to strike price B, involves selling a call option at that price ($165 in this case) and using the proceeds to offset the cost of the second leg. The second leg, corresponding to strike price A ($145), entails purchasing a call option. The payoff of the strategy can be calculated using the following formula, where P represents the profit, K1 and K2 are the strike prices, T1 and T2 are the premiums paid and received, respectively, and S is the current stock price: P = (T2 - max(0, S - K2)) + (max(0, S - K1) - T1). Applying this formula to Nathan's proposed strategy, with current prices at the time of the calculation, yields a payoff (-$7.80), which takes into account a single option contract and zero transaction costs. However, it is essential to factor in transaction costs when trading options, as they can significantly impact overall profitability."}

The legislation was introduced to prevent prominent developers from establishing themselves in a low-VAT country and selling apps to citizens of EU countries at a much lower VAT rate. To reclaim these funds, registering for VAT and submitting quarterly nil-returns is necessary, although it may be inconvenient. As outlined in a Kotaku article from 2014, the UK has an exemption for businesses earning less than \u00a381,000 a year, which eliminates the need to pay VAT on sales. However, none of the other EU member countries have such an exemption, so when the legislation was put in place, no exemption was factored in. This means that anyone who sells something digital to individuals in another EU country, regardless of the amount earned, must register for VAT in the UK and pay taxes at the buyer's residence rate. It's worth noting that this regulation only applies to those earning less than \u00a381,000 in sales made to individuals in the UK. Although Brexit may significantly impact the law, the regulations could change. The official Google link detailing how and which countries are affected is https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/138000?hl=en.

We tend to forget that there is always someone on the opposing side who may have the opposite stance. Thus, it's important to keep in mind that trading is a zero-sum game. However, from the viewpoint of market makers, their primary goal is not necessarily to profit from your losses, but to earn money through the bid-offer spread and hedging their positions. To reduce their exposure in certain directions, a market maker might quote one side of the market lower than the best available bid or higher than the lowest offer.

If the price of the asset increases before the future date, you will have to sell at a loss. The severity of the loss is determined by the magnitude of the price increase. To ensure payment, you must provide margin, which covers your payment obligations in the event of a loss. Without margin, derivative bets could cause catastrophic market disruption.

{"563": "\n\nAs a resident of the Philippines, I understand that I can only claim medical expenses from one health insurance policy, even if I have multiple policies. In the United States, multiple claims for medical bills or reimbursement cannot be submitted to different insurance companies. However, if coverage is provided by more than one policy and a claim is not paid by one company, the remaining balance can be submitted to another insurance company covering the same individual. Typically, employer-provided insurance coverage must be billed first, and any remaining cost is covered by private insurance. These insurance policies can be expensive and have large deductibles, with coverage only kicking in after the deductible has been met. Such policies usually payout to only a few individuals because of their high deductibles. Conversely, full-fledged coverage insurance policies pay much smaller deductibles and payouts occur more frequently. Some professional groups in the United States offer major medical coverage to their US members, which may cover non-US members as well, although this is not a certainty."}

{"565": "\n\nRevised: Simultaneously owning a stock through a fund and selling it short should have no net financial effect, similar to not owning the stock at all. This principle holds true for both personal finances and for the stock's price. Imagine a scenario where a group of index fund investors collectively owns and sells short 25% of Evil Oil Company's outstanding shares. This action effectively simulates selling their own company shares, which is typically not a viable option. Consequently, when 25% of the company stock becomes available in the market, the stock price declines. \n\nRegarding how this tactic affects personal finances, consider a scenario where the stock price rises, and the investors must return the borrowed shares to the lender. To do this, they purchase 1 million shares at market prices, hence driving prices up. Subsequently, they sell another million shares short, causing prices to drop. If enough investors apply this tactic, the stock price can be significantly affected, forcing the company's management to act in a manner that pleases the investors. Though, as an illustration, the company might issue a press release and sack the employee who demanded a bribe from your wife's estate to regain your investment business. However, this is not always the case."}
{"566": "\n\nThere are different ways to approach the analysis of who benefits from rising oil prices. Looking at it from a fundamental perspective may provide a high-level understanding; however, the impact on individual sectors and companies is more nuanced. For instance, higher oil prices may have a positive effect on electric car producers but negatively affect branded clothes manufacturers compared to discount clothes retailers.\n\nAnother approach is to use statistical analysis. I conducted a quick and preliminary correlation study between the various S&P sector indices and crude oil prices. The results suggest that materials and energy stocks should perform well with rising oil prices. However, this is a generalized behavior at the group level, and it may not apply to individual companies within those sectors. For instance, some companies in the materials sector may benefit from higher oil prices, while others may be adversely affected.\n\nOne way to gain exposure to these sectors is by investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as XLB and XLE in the US. Alternatively, one can conduct a correlation analysis for each stock within the S&P 500 index and create a portfolio of the most correlated stocks. This analysis is based on monthly returns over ten years after adjusting for the market component of each sector. The two critical columns to consider are:"}

This means that until the loan is fully paid off, you will owe the full amount.\n\nEven if you didn't personally benefit from the car purchase, that doesn't change the fact that you've taken on debt. Lenders and courts are solely concerned with the loan agreement that you signed. So, regardless of who receives the car or its benefits, you are liable for the loan amount as long as it remains unpaid.\n\nIf you wish to resolve this situation and no longer be responsible for the loan, then you must pay back the amount that you borrowed.

{"568": "\n\nIn certain cases, a company has a responsibility to distribute profits as either dividends or through a stock buyback program. However, activist investors regularly demand one or the other when a company is thriving, which may negatively impact future growth in some people's perceptions; in some cases, these investors may even file lawsuits against the company for failing to perform its duty to shareholders by holding onto cash. Apple is a notable example of a company that refused to distribute profits for several years under Steve Jobs, but eventually began providing both - a substantial dividend and a share buyback program that increases the remaining shares' value as the earnings-per-share (EPS) goes up with fewer shares available. Investors such as Carl Icahn often apply significant pressure, particularly when corporations are holding onto hundreds of billions of dollars. \n\nThe primary responsibility of a for-profit organization's board is to maximize shareholder wealth. As a result, the board can undertake various measures, such as buying back shares, paying dividends, selling or liquidating the company, or expanding the business as long as it justifies to the shareholders that it is still attempting to maximize their holdings' value. During the growth phase, corporations may not provide any return on investment; instead, they reinvest profits in the company. The long-term plan, however, is typically to either return funds in the form of dividends from earnings or through the company's sale."}
{"569": "\n\nRevised: To provide clarity, let's use an example. Let's say that in any given year, the revenue is 200K and the profit is 60K. In this scenario, you receive 40K in profit, plus your salary, and your partner gets 20K. However, if a competitor offers to buy the company and you accept, you would receive 100% of the proceeds, which could be a disadvantageous deal for your partner. You could manipulate the company's accounting to reduce profits and subsequently reduce your partner's pay. To avoid this, it is recommended to include a revenue metric in your partner's compensation. One solution would be to have his salary dependent on the revenue he generates. For example, if you can make a widget for 4 and sell it for 10, your profit would be 6. With a suggested split, your partner would receive $2, and you would receive $4. Another option is to have him receive 15% of the revenue generated, considering discounts for bulk items and the cost of processing sales. This method also allows him to share revenue with his staff. You could also consider a split, such as 7.5% of revenue and 10% of profit. It's great to hear that you value fair treatment for your partner, as honesty in business is essential for long-term success."}
{"570": "\n\nUnemployment insurance serves as a temporary safety net for workers who become unemployed by providing a portion of their salary for particular periods. As each state manages its own unemployment insurance program, it is important to note that the rules may differ from state to state. To receive unemployment insurance payments, it is crucial to have lost the job through no fault of one's own. If you quit your job, were let go due to poor performance or other valid reasons, you are not permitted to obtain unemployment insurance benefits. The unemployment insurance program in each state requires claimants to have worked for a certain duration before they can claim benefits.\n\nOnce applying for unemployment insurance, an agency in the state of residency will verify the conditions of a layoff by communicating with the former employer to ensure that the job was lost due to lack of work rather than the claimant's decision. Following this verification process, the weekly payment amount will be calculated based on a portion of the previous job\u2019s pay, usually between 20% to 50%, depending on the specific state. The purpose of the payment is to replace only a fraction of the previous salary and cover weekly essentials like food and utilities until the individual finds a new job.\n\nBefore obtaining benefits, there is typically a waiting period of one to two weeks.  If you secure a new role during this time, you will not be eligible for unemployment benefits, even if the pay is lower than the prior job. Employers fund the unemployment insurance program through payroll taxes. The employee's work history and earnings overall are important to qualify for unemployment benefits, but the money does not come from their paychecks. Several factors determine how much an employer should pay for unemployment insurance contributions, such as calculating based on the total number of former employees who received benefits.\n\nEmployers will pay taxes on an employee's base wages, which differ by state. An example of this is California where the employer tax is only for the first $7,000 of an employee's annual earnings; alternatively, Oregon charges tax on up to $32,000 annually. After catering for funds during the payroll period, employers must report taxes and pay state quarterly. Different categories of tax rates are charged by states to employers depending on various factors such as NJ employees might be more likely to qualify for Employee Retention Incentive Grants.\n\nWhen businesses operate above the board, they may receive discounts under the classification of the \"experienced rate.\" Depending on the number of workers a business has and how many former workers have claimed unemployment, states may grant considerable rate reductions. The fewer claims, the lower the rate a business may have to pay in unemployment insurance taxes. Covid-19 pandemic has forced the extension of unemployment insurance benefits as regular benefits last for a maximum of 26 weeks in most states. However, additional weeks of extended unemployment benefits are available during times of high unemployment. The unemployment extension legislation passed by Congress in February 2012 modified the way the tiers of Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) are structured. A tier of unemployment equals an extension of a right amount of weeks of unemployment benefits, and there are currently four tiers of unemployment benefits on call that provide additional weeks of unemployment on top of basic state unemployment benefits. For more information, see the Unemployment Tiers link.\n\nState unemployment offices can provide useful resources for filing applications for unemployment insurance benefits over the internet. It is essential to note the About and eHow links shared for job seekers to glean relevant insights into the process."}

Since gas cards were included in the promotion, I purchased a significant amount of them. Later, I attempted to buy grocery store gift cards at the end of the quarter with the intention of using them to buy gas cards in the future. Unfortunately, the store did not allow me to buy gift cards with a gift card, so I am now stuck with $1,000 in grocery cards until I use them for actual grocery purchases. However, the grocery store rewards program partners with a gas station, and for every $100 spent in-store, customers receive 10 cents off per gallon, which doubles to 20 cents off per gallon if you buy a $100 gift card. They also offer a coupon on the back of the receipt for an additional 10 cents off per gallon, which is doubled on Tuesdays. Although it seems that very few people take advantage of this program, I do. \n\nAs a side note, I changed the billing cycle of my Chase Freedom card to end on the 24th of the month.

It is ideal to leave the money in the account for a long period, preferably until retirement. Whole life insurance combines investment and insurance in a single payment. Although convenient, its investment returns are generally lower than other options.

IRC \u00a783 applies to property that has been granted but still faces a significant risk of forfeiture, such as unvested equity given to employees. \u00a783(a) defers taxation until the risk of forfeiture has abated, meaning that no taxes will be paid until the stock vests. \u00a783(b) enables the taxpayer to make a quick election to waive the risk of forfeiture within 30 days of transfer. After election, the normal operation of \u00a783 kicks in, and taxable income is typically the difference between the value of vested property and its original purchase price. If the stock is purchased at fair market value, there will be no difference, and the income from the shares will be zero. However, the shares will now be considered capital assets for tax purposes, and not compensation income. Upon selling the shares, any appreciation beyond the value at election will be considered capital gains.

It may be better to use standard stock analysis techniques such as understanding stock basics, reading stock quotes, and analyzing the P/E ratio and dividend yield. For mature companies, a good P/E ratio would be around 20, while for smaller and growing companies, a higher P/E ratio may be acceptable.

{"583": "\n\n\nRevised: \n\nIn the UK, the \"same day rule\" is utilized for matching purposes only. It requires that sales on any given day be matched primarily with purchases made on that same day to determine any gains or losses. This gives rise to the practice of \"bed-and-breakfast,\" or b&b, transactions, which are typically used for tax planning purposes. The aim is to crystalize a gain, within the exempted amount, and reset a purchase price at a higher level. One would execute a sale just before the market closes on one day, to be matched with the original purchase, and buy back the shares the next day, immediately after the market open. This process is useful whenever there is a paper gain that one wishes to lock and prevent from being taxed. By using up the annual exemption every year, one can, hopefully, reduce the tax burden. However, this strategy may be pointless if the dealing costs outweigh the potential tax savings. \n\nFor example, let's consider a scenario where the UK tax year aligns with the calendar year. Suppose that in 2016, you bought shares for a total of Stg. 50,000. By the end of the year, the shares are worth Stg. 54,000, an unrealized gain of Stg.4,000. Should you perform a b&b transaction to utilize your Stg.11,100 annual exemption? \n\nThe answer depends on the transaction costs involved. Assuming a 1.5% round-trip trade cost, and a 0.5% stamp duty on purchase, the total expenses of the b&b operation would be Stg1,080. The tax saved, assuming that you are a 20% taxpayer and deducting the transaction costs from the net gain, would be 20%x(4,000-1,080) = Stg584. This does not make financial sense. \n\nIn another scenario, the shares are worth Stg.60,000 at the end of 2016. The total transaction costs of a 2% round-trip trade cost would be 2%x60,000 = Stg1,200. Consequently, the taxable gain of Stg.10,000, less the transaction costs, would be Stg.8,800. The tax bill would be 20%x8,800 = Stg1,760, and so the transaction costs would be lower than the tax saved. It would make financial sense to crystalize the gain, selling the shares one day before the tax year-end and reinvesting immediately on the next day. \n\nIn the third scenario, the shares are worth Stg.70,000 at the end of 2016. The gain of Stg.20,000, less transaction and annual exemption costs, would result in a tax bill of Stg.1,500. However, the gain still exceeds the annual exemption. To avoid paying higher taxes, one would sell enough shares to crystalize a taxable gain of Stg.11,100. The fraction, f%, required would be f%x(70,000-50,000) - 2%xf%x70,000 = 11,100, which simplifies to f% = 11,100/18,600 = 59.68%. The tax saved would be 20%x11,100 = Stg.2,220, versus costs of 2%x59.58%x70,000 = Stg.835.52. This strategy of partial b&b is adopted because it never makes sense to pay tax early!"}
{"584": "\n\nWhen it comes to buying new cars, the norm is to either finance at a low APR or receive cashback when purchasing outright. However, determining how much a used car is worth can be challenging as the buyer often has no idea how much the seller has invested in the vehicle. It is perplexing that a seller would offer a discount of $2,000 if the buyer finances their purchase but not if they pay cash. The only motivation for such a maneuver could be the aim to obtain at least $2,000 in interest over the loan's lifetime. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the buyer won't refinance. Therefore, this could be a bluff, and the seller may agree to lower the price by $2,000, given that the buyer pays in cash or provides a check. If the seller insists, the buyer could agree to finance the purchase and then pay off the loan within a week. It is imperative to double-check whether there are any hidden charges, such as origination fees or pay-off-early fees, before determining the best course of action."}

{"587": "\n\nIf you enjoy math, try this thought experiment: Imagine the result X of a random walk process (although stocks don't behave this way, this example is useful for understanding the question you asked). On the first day, X is set to an integer X1. On each successive day, X can increase or decrease by 1, each with a probability of 1/2. Now let's consider buying a call option on X. Assume a European option with a strike price of S that expires on day N, which, if held until that day and exercised if it's profitable, would result in a value Y = min(X[N]-S, 0). This has an expected value E[Y] that can be calculated. The market value of that option on day #k, where 1 < k < N, should be V[k] = E[Y]|X[k], which can also be calculated. On day #N, V[N] is equal to Y, as its value is known. \n\nOn the other hand, an American option would result in a value Y[k] = min(X[k]-S, 0) if it were held until day #k and then exercised if profitable. For now, let's forget about selling the option on the market. This means that the only two choices are either to exercise it on some day #k or to let it expire. Let's say it's day k=N-1. If X[N-1] is greater than or equal to S+1 (in the money), there are two choices: exercise today or exercise tomorrow if profitable. The expected value is the same in both cases (both are equal to X[N-1]-S), so it's better to exercise right away and make use of the money elsewhere. Now suppose X[N-1] is less than or equal to S-1 (out of the money), in which case the expected value is 0 whether you exercise today or wait until tomorrow. That\u2019s because even the best-case scenario would be X[N-1]=S-1 and X[N] goes up to S, so the option is still worthless. \n\nHowever, if X[N-1] = S (at the money), it gets more interesting. If it's exercised today, it's worth 0; if you wait until tomorrow, there's a 1/2 chance it's worth 0 (if X[N]=S-1), and a 1/2 chance it's worth 1 (if X[N]=S+1). Therefore, the expected value is 1/2, so you should wait until tomorrow. \n\nNow let's move to day k=N-2. In a similar situation, if X[N-2] is greater than or equal to S+2, you can either sell it today (in which case you know the value is X[N-2]-S), or you can wait until tomorrow when the expected value is also X[N-2]-S. Again, you might as well exercise it now. If X[N-2] is less than or equal to S-2, you know the option is worthless. If X[N-2] is equal to S-1, it's worth 0 today; however, if you wait until tomorrow, it's either worth an expected value of 1/2 if it goes up (X[N-1]=S), or 0 if it goes down, for a net expected value of 1/4, so you should wait. If X[N-2] is equal to S, it's worth 0 today; tomorrow it's either worth an expected value of 1 if it goes up, or 0 if it goes down, netting an expected value of 1/2, so you should wait. If X[N-2] is equal to S+1, it's worth 1 today; tomorrow it's either worth an expected value of 2 if it goes up or 1/2 if it goes down (X[N-1]=S), which results in a net expected value of 1.25, so you should wait. \n\nNow, imagine it's day k=N-3. If X[N-3] is greater than or equal to S+3, E[Y] = X[N-3]-S, and you should exercise it now. If X[N-3] is less than or equal to S-3, E[Y]=0. But if X[N-3] equals S+2, there's an expected value E[Y] of (3+1.25)/2 = 2.125 if you wait until tomorrow, versus exercising it now with a value of 2; if X[N-3]=S+1 then E[Y] = (2+0.5)/2 = 1.25, versus exercise value of 1; if X[N-3]=S then E[Y] = (1+0.5)/2 = 0.75 versus exercise value of 0; if X[N-3]=S-1 then E[Y] = (0.5 + 0)/2 = 0.25, versus exercise value of 0; if X[N-3]=S-2 then E[Y] = (0.25 + 0)/2 = 0.125, versus exercise value of 0. Waiting until tomorrow is better in each of these five cases. \n\nYou can keep continuing this process using the recursion formula E[Y]|X[k]=S+d, where d is a difference between X[k] and S. The equation considers different scenarios for the option's value in the future and advises whether to exercise the option now or wait. The expected value of an American option on X is greater than the expected value of a European option on X. The intuitive reason is that if the option is in the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be out of the money, the option should be exercised early (or sold), which is not possible with a European option. If it is nearly at the money, the option should be held, whereas if it is out of the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be in the money, the option is definitely worthless. Note that real securities don't follow random walks, and their probabilities are more complex and time-varying. Nonetheless, similar situations exist, and a high probability that a stock will go down signals it's time to exercise/sell an in-the-money American option, which is not possible with a European option. Interestingly, the computation provided above for the random walk isn't too different conceptually from the Binomial options pricing model."}
{"588": "\n\nI received confirmation from SIPC that littleadv's answer is correct. To provide some context, the Securities Investor Protection Act (\"SIPA\") provides protections in the event of a liquidation proceeding for a SIPC member broker-dealer. These protections apply to securities and related cash held by the broker-dealer in custody for the customer. In the event of a failure of a SIPC member broker-dealer, SIPC's obligation is to restore the securities and cash to the customer within statutory limits, but not necessarily the original value of the purchase. SIPC does not protect against any decline in value of securities. The protection offered by SIPC is up to $500,000 per customer, including a $250,000 limit on the cash in the account. Note that this protection only applies if you entrust cash or securities with a U.S. SIPC member.

It presents diversification as a magic trick without acknowledging the crucial fact that true diversification requires perfectly negatively correlated stocks to reduce risk effectively. Simply owning two S&P 500 indexes is not sufficient to diversify one's portfolio. True diversification involves spreading investments across various asset classes such as small-cap, large-cap, bonds, international, commodities, and real estate. It is important to understand that even with true diversification, there is always some level of risk involved. Return and risk are backward calculations that cannot guarantee future performance due to unpredictable changes in technology, outsourcing, currency exchange rates, political instability, or scandal."}

If you have a firm conviction that an asset\u2019s value will rise, or if the potential gains are enticing enough for you to keep it, you are a speculator. There are several methods for speculating, including holding high-risk assets without hedging, and leveraging or using the underlying leverage of derivative contracts to amplify risk and reward. In general, if in anticipation, you pay to decrease your risk, you are a hedger. If you are, in anticipation, being rewarded for bearing the risk that someone else would otherwise bear, you are a speculator. Despite the negative connotation that politicians and others have given to speculation, it is what we are all doing when we purchase stocks or any other volatile asset."}

The current rates are so low that you could make more than the average 3% return on the market per year and earn some profit. It wouldn't be surprising if for half of your loan term, you were able to earn just as much in interest! Personally, I have taken this approach with my own home and rental properties, and have made over 9% each of the past three years, earning me an additional $12,000 each year on top of what I would have paid in interest. This decision has benefited me greatly, earning me $36,000 for essentially doing nothing. Although the market may experience some downturn in the coming years, I have a history of success with this approach. It's not about timing the market, but rather the time you spend in it. Over 15 years, you stand to make a pretty safe investment, though perhaps not as much as if you just paid off your mortgage."}
{"595": "\n\nThe brokerage firm will purchase shares for dividends in an omnibus account to ensure the security of the issuer. Then, they will distribute fractional shares to all clients who chose Div Reinvest. To account for the fractional portion, the firm will buy one extra share, as the market does not permit trading of fractional shares. Div Reinvest usually has no impact on the marketplace, except in cases where certain securities pay large dividends but are not liquid. This is sometimes the case for preferred securities, where a large amount of Div reinvestment could create a big market order that could have market impact. Most brokers use market orders for the day following the dividend payment. When selling fractional portions, the same process applies as for full shares, and the fractional shares are traded between the client and the broker's omnibus account. If the broker's omnibus account has .6 shares and the client sells .5, resulting in a full share for the broker, they are likely to sell it to the market with the full share portion of the order. This process does not impact outstanding shares, and all costs are operational and handled by the broker as part of the Div reinvestment service."}

At expiration, if the underlying asset ABC stays within the $5 - $7 range, the put value will be between $8 and $10.

While finding a pattern in a data set may be easy, discovering a pattern that remains true in various data sets from the same population can be difficult. Similarly, avoid searching for a pattern in data from the entire population, as this won't provide a means to test it. Without a means of testing a pattern, it becomes challenging to distinguish between patterns that have a cause and will likely persist and those that are the result of random variation.\n\nIf you experience losses during poor market periods, don't fret. As long as your gains during good market periods outpace your losses, you'll ultimately profit. If you invest $10 and lose 50%, you'll have to make a 100% profit to recover your initial investment.\n\nA Black Swan event, as popularized by Nassim Taleb, is unforeseeable but almost certainly will occur at some point. For instance, a significant natural disaster will likely impact a large country such as the United States in the next year or two, but the location and severity of such an event are unknown. Similarly, Black Swan events can affect financial markets, and although we don't know what they will be or when they will occur, we can be sure that they will happen. When constructing a system, ensure that it can weather these unforeseen occurrences and remain above the 'death line.'\n\nRecreating your work from scratch is an excellent method for reevaluating your initial assumptions in light of the final system.

This aligns with the IRS page, which indicates that contributions are limited to the lesser of a percentage of one's income or $53,000. In essence, the $53,000 acts as a ceiling, preventing individuals from contributing more than this amount even if 20% of their earnings exceeds this limit. The variation in the contribution percentage (20% vs. 25%) between the two sources reflects differences in the contribution limits for employees versus self-employed individuals, as explained in Publication 560.

For instance, if your credit limit equals your monthly income and you pay off your card balance each month, overspending becomes less likely as you only have access to the amount you can afford to spend. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that a slightly higher credit limit can help avoid fees that arise from exceeding your credit limit. Furthermore, not all purchases may be immediately deducted from your available credit - some shops may only send their takings to the bank at the end of the day, giving the impression that you have more credit than you actually do, and potentially resulting in fees if you overspend."}
{"606": "\n\nThere are several options available, but without more information, I can only provide examples. Last year, I considered purchasing a house, but I ultimately decided against it due to the difficult market conditions in my area. If I had decided to buy, my mother offered to provide me with a private loan, which I would repay over time with 3% interest. She would not have any ownership of the house, as it was not her intention. If your father is considering owning the house and renting it to you, this could be an option if you are comfortable with renting.\n\nAnother option that we considered but ultimately discarded due to additional expenses was taking out a loan with a bank, paying 4.5% interest to the bank, and the bank paying under 1% to my mother while keeping the rest. It is important to keep in mind that banks always seek to make a profit, and this profit comes from the difference in interest rates. If your father has 230k in the bank and you owe 230k to the bank, it may be better to avoid involving the bank, as long as your father is comfortable lending you the money and you are comfortable owing him money. Your comfort levels and your father's comfort level are key factors. If possible, try to avoid involving banks and set up a written contract between yourself and your father.

{"607": "\n\nBefore editing, Pete had mentioned that real estate agents want you to (a) buy the most expensive house you can afford and (b) show you a few options and have you choose from them. As someone who works as a real estate agent, I believe this is an understatement. Just like any other industry, there are good and bad people in real estate. Agents are paid to sell houses. If the median price of a home in the US is under $200,000, and commissions average around 5%, then the seller and buyer brokers will split a $10,000 commission. Each agent will receive $5,000, and that amount will include a portion shared with their brokerage. Consequently, the amount received per sale will be around $2,500, which is not much. Making one sale per week could generate a considerable income, while making a sale once a month will make very little. Tire kickers, or prospective buyers who are not yet committed, will waste an agent's time by delaying their purchasing decision. The agents' obligation is to tell you the truth but not to offer financial advice. It isn't easy to forget the mortgage crisis, and it appears that the banks and brokers are not looking out for your best interests either. They will tell you the amount they will lend you, but not how much you can actually afford. These two numbers can differ greatly. Therefore, I strongly suggest that you put down at least 20%. For instance, the FHA PMI calculator shows that a 90% LTV, which requires a 10% downpayment, will cost you $1,200 per year in PMI, for a $100,000 home. For the $10,000 that you did not put down, you will pay an extra $1,200 annually on top of interest. Even at 5%, the last $10,000 will cost you nearly 17% in total. If you cannot raise $10,000 or whatever 10% of the total house price requires in cheaper funds, it is best to wait. You can also consider using a 401(k) loan for this purpose, but it comes with high emotions. Finally, instead of buying the largest home you can afford, it is better to purchase a smaller place that you can tolerate. For instance, I have a living room (in addition to the family room) that I have used only three times in the past 20 years, but we use our dining room twice a year. If your home is 50% too large, you will pay 50% more in property taxes, utility bills, and maintenance costs, which leads to a significant amount of lifetime expenses. Even if closing costs, commission, and other expenses are not cheap, the cost of living in a home that is too large for your needs will eventually end up becoming a money pit."}
{"608": "\n\nConsider whether a UTMA account is right for you, as it may not suit your needs. One of the main drawbacks of a UTMA account is that it will count as your child's assets, potentially affecting their eligibility for financial aid. Furthermore, taxes are not deferred as in a 529 plan. Lastly, when your child reaches 18, they will have control over the account and may spend the money as they wish, which may not align with your plans. \n\nA 529 plan boasts several advantages over a UTMA account. For instance, grandparents may open the account with your child as the beneficiary, and the money does not count toward financial aid calculations for college (although this rule is subject to change). The plan's earnings grow tax-free, resulting in greater growth overall. You can contribute much more to the plan without triggering the gift tax (currently about $60k), and some states offer state tax breaks for contributing to the plan. Additionally, the account holder (the grandparents) will prevent your child from spending the money irresponsibly on teenage frivolities. \n\nHowever, it is worth noting that a 10% penalty applies to unused funds from 529 plans not used for higher education expenses. That being said, if the money is left in the account for 20 years, the tax-free growth may balance out the penalty depending on your tax bracket and the applicable tax rates over the 20-year period."}
{"609": "At this point, we have compelling arguments for both a yes and a no answer. However, in my opinion, the most accurate response is... maybe. While it is true that most of your expenses are in dollars, there is a significant complication that I will attempt to simplify. Many of the goods and services you purchase are priced on the international market, such as oil. When the dollar is strong, the price of oil is low, but when it is weak, the price of oil can increase. On the other hand, services like a back massage are typically paid for in dollars, and the person receiving payment only wants dollars, so the strength or weakness of the currency does not matter in this situation.\n\nMost people's expenses are a combination of goods and services priced both internationally and locally, with a bias towards local expenditures. If their investment portfolio also has a mix of domestic and international investments, some of which are dependent on the strength of the dollar and some of which are not, they do not need to be overly concerned about the currency's strength or weakness when selling their investments and buying what they need. If the dollar is weak, international goods will be more expensive, but at the same time, the international portion of their portfolio will be worth more. If you plan on retiring in a different country or if your entire investment portfolio is in emerging market stocks, you may want to consider either currency hedging or altering your investment mix.\n\nHowever, for most people, a good mix of domestic and international investments offers the benefits of diversification while covering the risk that the currency will weaken. The best part is that you do not need to try to predict the direction of the dollar's movement.\n\nIn summary, if you want to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on your portfolio, you may want to consider hedging. If you want your retirement to not depend on currency movements, then having a good mix of local and unhedged international investments would be an ideal option."}

Although the value of a sole proprietor may not be as high as that of a company, they still require many of the same services. Therefore, Indian banks provide a scaled-down version of the account offered to companies, which includes excellent overdraft options that allow for withdrawing funds even when the balance is zero. This feature is highly beneficial as business cycles and payment schedules can vary for each supplier or customer. For instance, consider a scenario where a sole proprietor's account has a zero balance on day 0, and customer X makes a payment by cheque on day 1. The cheque will not be credited until day 3 (assuming day 2 is a holiday or weekend). Meanwhile, the proprietor writes a cheque to a supplier on day 0, and the supplier deposits it on that same day, which the bank debits on day 1. However, with the overdraft facility, the proprietor can borrow from the bank until the customer's cheque is credited on day 3. Interestingly, current accounts were available long before Indian banks customized accounts for corporate customers.

It is important to keep in mind three key points about IPOs: Firstly, it is the method used to make a private company publicly owned. Secondly, selling shares to the public allows for original owners and investors to withdraw their investment, and thirdly, it can provide the company with greater financial resources to support its growth.\n\nFor airlines, a capital-intensive business, new planes such as the B737-MAX or A320neo can cost over $110M and $105M USD, respectively. However, the definition of a successful IPO depends on how one perceives success, and the initial airberlin IPO was constructed with management and owners focusing on cashing out their shares, rather than providing necessary investments for the company's growth.\n\nConsequently, the market viewed the IPO unfavourably. However, the investment bankers restructured it to increase the issuance of new shares, thereby resulting in a better cash infusion for the company.

These companies use rewards cards to entice disorganized individuals into accumulating interest fees and late payments, as they are the companies' most profitable customers. For them, it is a successful business model. You, however, reduce their profit in transaction fees. As a result, the companies have no incentive to help you increase your profits. In response to your comment, the bottom line is a matter of perspective. While you are a rational and altruistic person who aims to create a mutually beneficial situation in business, credit card companies operate to reduce your freedom financially.

With reward cards, studies suggest that individuals tend to spend about 17% more. I personally stopped using reward cards for situations in which I have to make a decision at the point of purchase. For people with tight budgets, reward cards can lead to debt. My \"meager profits\" paragraph essentially seeks to indicate the perpetual nature of credit card companies in extracting profit. They make no effort to earn only 2% on purchases and give back 1% for free, although this would be beneficial for all parties involved.

{"628": "\n\nRevised: When it comes to trading in your crossover, keep in mind that the value offered will typically be lower than what you could receive in a private sale. To address your question directly, I recommend selling the vehicle yourself and using the profit to buy your new ride. And, if you plan on financing the purchase after the lease term, my strong suggestion is to forego leasing altogether and use the $9k to finance directly. Leasing can end up being a costly venture, as it won't save you any money over the long-term and can expose you to potential fees for breaking certain lease terms, such as mileage and wear and tear. From a mathematical standpoint, your best option is to use the $9k as a cash payment towards your purchase. This will ultimately result in the lowest total cost of ownership. Even if you're concerned about purchasing a car with hidden issues, leasing is an expensive form of insurance against that possibility. In order to justify leasing over cash payment throughout the vehicle's lifetime, you would have to incur some substantial repair costs - which is not typically the case."}

However, when making purchases, there is no existing debt to the business owner, and therefore, the aforementioned rule does not apply. Payment for purchases is determined through mutual agreement between both parties. It is reasonable for businesses such as a 7/11 or taxi company, which are frequently targeted for robberies, and small retailers that lack the resources for fraud detection to request customers to use smaller bills. This practice of accepting small bills and declining large ones is perfectly legal, and further explanations and code references can be found on the Treasury.gov website."}
{"630": "\n\nI am not a fan of Muro questions. As a personal finance investor focused on saving for retirement, they don't hold much value for me. If I cannot grasp a company's basic business model or how it generates profits, I won't invest. On the other hand, if I do understand it, I'll conduct more research on the company before making any purchases. I prefer index funds that track industries and companies that I am familiar with. While I rely on a fund manager to handle the details, I still apply a simple logic test to ensure I am on the right path, and I don't rely on the opinions of rating agencies. As for my place in the system as a whole, I'm not certain. I lack the resources to conduct rigorous accounting research and analysis that rating agencies do, which could lead me to lose potential investments even if the business model is solid. It is up to my fund manager to determine if a company is ethical or not. To mitigate this risk, I invest in indexes rather than individual stocks."}
{"631": "\n\nHow can it be that long-term treasury bonds, which the government has never defaulted on, can carry more risk as an ETF than the stock market index? The risk involved with long-term bonds doesn't stem from the possibility of government default, but rather from the chance that interest rates may increase before you receive payment. If investors prefer bonds issued more recently with higher interest rates, then your older bonds offering a lower rate will decrease in value (thus lowering bond prices). This is often due to higher inflation rates, which diminishes the worth of the interest payment. Does investing in bond ETFs result in more risk compared to investing in individual bonds? If you are wisely selecting ETFs, there should be less risk since they handle the challenge of buying an assortment of bonds.  Is investing in bond ETFs a suitable choice for risk diversification? Yes, if you're investing in bonds, then buying them via an exchange-traded fund is an appropriate way to do so. ETF markets are reliably liquid."}

In my experience, most banks won't penalize you for sending extra money and will apply it towards early payments rather than principal, but it's best to confirm with your bank directly. For example, with student loans, you may need to provide a detailed list of your loans and the order in which you'd like extra payments applied. Otherwise, your payment may be considered an early payment or distributed evenly across all loans."}

Every investor could match market performance easily and affordably by purchasing an S&P index fund and holding it. Additionally, some investors can even surpass market performance by adding select stocks to their portfolios. For example, consider the ten-year comparison chart of Berkshire Hathaway B compared to the S&P 500. Although other examples exist, few of us possess the discipline necessary to achieve such performance. Every week, we read questions regarding market turbulence, the next big trend, the next bubble, and the like.

If you're actively searching for a home, it's unlikely that you won't find something within three months. If your offer has been accepted and you're in the midst of the process and escrow has been opened, the preapproval will likely be extended if it expires before closing. I recently encountered a similar scenario on the buyer's end where the seller's short sale approval expired, but it was extended to ensure closure. If you haven't started the process and your preapproval has expired, you may need to begin anew with associated fees.

{"663": "\n\nThis is an elaboration on the last paragraph of @BenMiller's response. When a mutual fund manager sells securities at a profit or receives dividends, the fund has the option of paying taxes on the money and distributing the remaining amount to shareholders, or passing the entire sum, categorized as dividends, qualified dividends, net short-term capital gains, and net long-term capital gains, to shareholders who then pay taxes at their respective rates. Negative net gains or losses are not passed on to shareholders. It's optional for a shareholder to reinvest their distribution back into the mutual fund; they can receive the money as cash, or invest in a different mutual fund from the same family. Moving to a different fund family usually requires a brokerage account, unlike within a mutual fund where it is not necessary. Cross-transfers can weigh in with rebalancing asset allocations, which is recommended to be done once or twice a year. Load fund investors must note that some waive the load for reinvestment of distributions, some don't, and any sales charge passed through a brokerage account is pure profit for the fund. As Ben notes, even if a shareholder chooses to have the entire distribution reinvested, they must still pay taxes. When a mutual fund declares a distribution, the Net Asset Value per share drops by the same amount, but the total investment amount remains unchanged. In summary, a distribution from a mutual fund that is reinvested leads to no change in net assets, but increases tax liability. Conversely, net capital losses are not distributed but instead retained within the fund to offset future capital gains. Refer to this or this previous answer for more information."}

For instance, new mining companies may not have enough cash flow to pay dividends while established companies with no lucrative projects left may choose to pay dividends. Therefore, saying \"dividend-paying\" or \"growth stocks\" is often a proxy for the life stage, risk, and return of a company. Tax implications also play a role in deciding between dividend and capital gains as taxation on dividends and stock sales varies by jurisdiction and income level. Finally, dividend policies can reflect differences in risk levels and life stages, but this is not always a guaranteed indicator. Ultimately, choosing a dividend policy depends on an investor's tax position and risk tolerance."}
{"674": "\n\nRevised: Having insurance may not be beneficial for everyone. Only a select few may benefit greatly from it. Insurance is essentially a wager, where you win when you lose. Unfortunately, very few people lose enough to come out as winners. For the majority of people, paying into insurance can result in a loss as they never receive as much as they put in. Therefore, for most individuals and situations, insurance is not a good investment. The reason why people seek insurance is because they are unable to accurately calculate the probability of something bad happening as well as an expert actuary. As a result, the insurance provider profits from the difference in knowledge. The provider is well-informed and sells products that customers may not ever need. However, many individuals struggle to understand probability and accurately assess risk. Understanding the true expense of risk is essential to comprehending money and wealth. Wealthy people are typically aware of the worth and cost of risk. They only purchase insurance when they anticipate a loss or crisis, meaning there is a possibility of winning. Wealthy people generally avoid gambling, except when they have the advantage. Therefore, when a self-made rich individual invests in something, it is because they anticipate a probable gain."}

{"683": "\n\nRob, I apologize that your first experience here hasn't been positive. However, I must point out that what you're requesting is beyond the capability of most software programs. If you visit Fairmark.com, you'll find that the standard deduction for married filing jointly was $12,200 in 2012 and increased to $12,400 in 2013. I would like to share an anecdote about deductions. When I first prepared my MIL's taxes, I had to explain to her that she didn't have enough deductions to itemize. Since then, she submits a file full of papers, but her medical deductions don't exceed 7.5% of her income. I return two folders to her, one with the necessary documents and one labeled \"trash.\" Fewer than 30% of taxpayers elect to itemize. Most who do, have no doubt that it's the correct choice, such as when their property tax exceeds the $12K standard deduction. Only those on the cusp of itemizing are likely to be frustrated. \n\nMy article on Standard Deduction versus Itemizing describes a method for reducing the number of deductible expenses in even years, thus allowing for an itemized deduction in alternating tax years. If this is your situation, you may find this concept interesting. \n\nYou inquire about filing status. After importing our W2's from ADP into TurboTax, I do the same with our stock information. Neither the stock data nor the Schedule A deductions are assigned a name. Therefore, any attempt to divide these for Married Filing Separately (MFS) would require the separation of these components. While TurboTax offers a 'what-if' worksheet for this function, it has no relevance since the \"marriage penalty\" was eliminated years ago; furthermore, items that phase out at certain income thresholds are usually lost to a separate filer anyhow. \n\nWhen I got married, I couldn't claim my real estate losses each year, which continued to accumulate until either I sold or our income decreased when my spouse retired. In conclusion, while I appreciate your desire for special features in software, I believe it's safe to say that it would not be of much use to most people. If this discussion continues, I would be interested if anyone could give an example of how filing separately genuinely benefits a couple."}
{"684": "\n\nI've noticed some lengthy and complex responses on this thread, so I'll keep it short and sweet: Let's use an economy with 10 apples and $10 as an example. In this case, an apple costs $1. If you print an additional $10, you'll end up with 10 apples and $20. This would make an apple cost $2. Simple, right?\n\nNow, I'd like to touch on the issue of inflation. In my opinion, it's nothing short of theft. If someone were to hack into a bank and steal 10% from every account, we'd call it theft. But when the government prints more money, which results in a 10% decrease in the value of people's bank accounts, it's not as obvious. However, the outcome is still the same.\n\nOne thing to note is that I don't believe that inflation occurs when the supply of goods drops - for example, if 5 out of the 10 apples in our original example had rotted and we now have 5 apples and $10, with each apple costing $2. In this situation, it's due to a decrease in supply, and if demand remains the same, prices will increase."}

By maintaining your current low rate, month after month, you'll pay the market rate on your new home while also earning rental income from your former property to offset the increased expense.

Reinsurance, on the other hand, entails insurance for insurance. If Company X needs to insure a risk, they approach Insurance Company A.

{"689": "\n\nWhere does the interest come from? The same place as other savings accounts. When you deposit money into a savings account, the bank invests it elsewhere, typically by lending it out to others. They make a profit as long as the interest they pay for borrowing from you, plus the cost of managing savings accounts and loans, is less than the interest they charge for lending to others. While banks are not obligated to pay interest, they do so to encourage clients to deposit funds with them instead of other banks that offer interest on deposits. The bank's goal is to pay as little as possible while retaining depositors and charging as much as possible without losing borrowers. Banks offer higher interest rates on loans than paid on deposits because loans carry higher risks than deposits, and there is additional work required to manage them. Investment with higher returns requires more work and higher risks along with larger reserves to cover any losses."}

For the future value of the initial deposit, we use the formula D(1 + i)n. For the future value of the payments, the formula is A((1+i)n-1) / i). By adding these two formulas together, we can determine the total amount of money that should be in our account at the end. Be sure to adjust the interest rate and number of payments accordingly. Divide the interest rate by the number of periods in a year (four for quarterly, twelve for monthly) and multiply the result by the number of periods (p).

The primary difference lies in the specific mechanics of the conversion process. A convertible bond, for example, functions like a traditional bond, paying periodic interest and having a face value due at maturity. However, the bondholder can opt to convert the debt into equity within the bond's lifespan, usually subject to specific conditions and limitations. In contrast, a convertible note is typically used in startup financing, redeemable not for cash but for equity as part of a later financing round. Rather than a fixed number of shares, the bondholder receives equity at a discount to the market price.

Check out the following links:\n\nSecondly, you may want to consider brokerages that specialize in buying smaller amounts of stocks regularly to simulate a DRIP.

As someone with experience in lending and real estate, my first question would be, what is the specific scenario for your purchase?\n\nAssuming you are seeking funding for an Owner Occupied, Super Jumbo Loan with a 20% down payment or $360K, on a $1.8 million purchase price, the loan amount would be approximately $1.45 million. It can be assumed that your FICO score is strong.\n\nIt is important to note that the more debt you have, the higher your backend-DTI, which can harm your chances of securing the deal. Your limit should ideally be less than 35%. While it is possible to obtain this loan, it is wise to keep more cash on hand, especially since buying at the current real estate peak means that there is a risk of a market downturn in the future.\n\nIn the event of a recession or decline in property values, if you do not have the funds to cover the loss, it could take close to a decade to recover your initial investment. Therefore, even if you do obtain the loan, it may be smarter to hold onto cash for other investments.\n\nUltimately, if you choose to pursue this deal, you will likely pay higher fees and points with a higher interest rate compared to the scenario with a 40% down payment. However, keeping additional funds available for investment purposes, such as cash-flow generating units, is advised.\n\nI have highlighted the important factors, including your debt-to-income ratio, in the yellow section of the image provided below. If your debt is low or non-existent, and your income is sufficient, you can proceed with the deal with a FICO score of at least 680.

This means you will not own any stock, as someone will just buy and sell it from you. You should then have incoming cash of $1500 from selling the stock to the call exerciser and outgoing cash of $1300 from buying from the put exerciser. This will leave you with $200 more cash in your account in the morning. Basically, in this options position, you agree to buy at $13 and sell at $15 at someone else's option.\n\nThe only way you can lose money is if one option is exercised, while the other isn't. So, if the stock price is below $13, no one will opt to buy from you for $15, but they'll sell to you for $13. On the other hand, if the stock price is above $15, no one will opt to sell to you at $13, but they'll buy from you at $15. If neither option is exercised, you get to keep the premium you sold for, and if both options are exercised, you get to keep the gap between the two, plus the premium. It is rare for both options to be exercised, especially early in the contract, but it can happen.

{"710": "\n\nI believe the concept is that by making extra principal payments in the early years of a mortgage, you can significantly reduce the overall interest expense throughout the loan's life due to the way mortgages are amortized. A HELOC works similarly to a credit card in that it accrues interest, but if you use it to make significant principal payments, you can pay off those portions of the debt faster than if you only made regular mortgage payments. While I don't have the exact calculations, I suspect that you can achieve comparable outcomes by simply paying more than the minimum required, such as making an extra payment annually, which can shave off 7-9 years from a 30-year loan. The benefit of using a HELOC loan is that it allows you to borrow more, which in turn may permit you to lower the mortgage's payments by recalculating them."}

For example, a charge to repair an existing sidewalk and any interest included in that charge may be deductible. \n\nIf only a part of the assessment is for maintenance, repair, or interest charges, you must be able to show the amount of that part to claim the deduction. If you cannot show what part of the assessment is for maintenance, repair, or interest charges, none of it is deductible. If an assessment for a local benefit is listed on your real estate tax bill, you should use the rules in this section to determine how much you may deduct. \n\nHowever, the issue arises when it comes to the Center City tax bill. If it is a separate line or bill, then it may not count. The CCD is a business improvement district that provides supplemental services to Philadelphia's downtown, but it is unclear whether residential property owners can be included or not. Some BIDs can accept tax-deductible donations, which may be deductible for itemizers. Essentially, if the deduction is not possible for homeowners, it should be deductible for others. It is best to consult a tax professional for a definitive answer."}

{"721": "\n\nA significant part of the issue is rooted in ignorance. Many people believe that the US government can default on its loans, despite the fact that it cannot. Additionally, the US government has the ability to create money whenever it needs it, and does not necessarily have to borrow to fund expenses. Unfortunately, these two crucial facts often elude many people, who believe the government should approach finances like a household, business or state government. This creates a significant disconnect, leading to confusion and sometimes even a fiscal crisis. However, as Rahm Emanuel once said, we shouldn't let a good crisis go to waste. It is important to note that this is not to suggest that the US should create money haphazardly without considering its implications. Rather, it is simply stating that it has the capacity to do so.

{"724": "\n\nChinese suppliers have the option to quote their prices in CNY rather than the usual USD, which would eliminate the risk of exchange rate fluctuations with the US dollar. The CNY has been consistently increasing in value, and agreeing to receive payments in USD when their costs are in CNY would result in suppliers being at a disadvantage, requiring them to increase their prices. Canadian importers would need to purchase RMB using CAD to pay for their orders, while Canadian exporters can receive payment in RMB or set their prices in CAD. This approach eliminates risks and reduces costs by bypassing the US dollar middleman. Japan adopted a similar practice several decades ago, switching from pricing their products in USD. This is significant in large transactions, not insignificant amounts related to tourism. The bilateral trade between China and Canada exceeds $70bn annually. The actual Forex trading may exceed the actual trade volumes, with the global Forex market being over ten times larger than the actual international trade volume.

{"726": "\n\nTo begin with, let me clarify some confusion about the Sterling Ratio. Although it is a useful measurement in personal finance, it may not be as applicable to foreign exchange trading systems. Typically, hedge funds use the Sterling Ratio to determine the risk-reward ratio of long-term investments. However, there are different interpretations of the Sterling Ratio, such as the definition proposed by Deane Sterling Jones, which is more suitable for measuring a trading system's long-term risk-reward ratio. For this calculation, the Average Annual Draw-down should be negative in the formula. This is an easy calculation to use to measure a portfolio's long-term results. For example, for a 5 or 10-year period, calculate the average of each year's largest drawdown. \n\nIt's worth noting that the Sterling Ratio is also applicable to personal investment portfolios. However, its common usage is in investment strategies like hedging, where long-term investments are made in securities that are anti-correlated. This helps to obtain a diverse portfolio with stable growth. The Average Largest Drawdown is the average between the maximum drawdown from each security in the portfolio. \n\nAs an example, consider that a portfolio contains five securities with maximum drawdowns of 0.12, 0.23, 0.06, 0.36, and 0.09. The Average Largest Drawdown would be the average of these values, which equals 0.172 or 17.2%. \n\nIn order to calculate the Sterling Ratio, the portfolio's annual return and the risk-free rate must be calculated. Generally, this ratio is calculated annually because it relies on the Annual Risk-Free Rate. If the portfolio's annual return is 15% and the risk-free rate is 10%, then the Sterling Ratio would be calculated as SR = (0.15 - 0.10)/0.172, resulting in a ratio of 0.29. The higher the ratio, the better the risk-reward ratio of your portfolio. \n\nIf you are looking to calculate a long-term risk-reward ratio for your trading system, then I would suggest using the original Sterling Ratio. If this is not applicable to your situation, then consider using the Sharpe and Sortino ratios instead."}

{"730": "\n\nRevised: With a gross income of $4,000 per month, approximately $1,000 per month can be allocated towards a mortgage. Based on current interest rates, this would translate to a borrowing capacity of around $200,000 from the bank. It's important to note that income qualifications are based on gross, rather than net income. Therefore, if the estimated annual income of $48,000 is inaccurate, the borrowing limit may need to be adjusted accordingly. While today's rates may allow for a mortgage up to four times one's gross income, I personally believe that it is too high. In my opinion, a more prudent borrowing limit would be 2.5-3 times one's income. It's important to keep in mind that the figures provided reflect what the bank may approve, rather than what may be a wise financial decision."}
{"731": "\n\nNet income is impacted by both internal and external factors beyond management's control, and should be complemented with other indicators to obtain a comprehensive assessment of a company's health. Initially, accounting was based on cash transactions, which could be misleading due to variations in cash flow. This led to the adoption of accrual-based accounting, which records transactions before the cash is exchanged, allowing for greater accuracy in financial reporting. However, this system also allowed for accounting manipulation, as demonstrated by Enron's fraudulent revenue accruals. Accounting guidelines are in place to limit such practices, although management still tries to accelerate net income whenever possible. Additionally, some items affecting profit are reported in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), which portrays events outside of management's control, such as changes in currency exchange rates or fluctuations in the stock market which impact the company's pension plan. Nevertheless, OCI may not capture all non-management-related events accurately. Given these nuances, net income is intended to reflect what is under management control, but it may not always provide a complete and accurate representation of a company's performance. Hence, other metrics must also be considered to provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a company's overall financial health."}

{"742": "\n\nThere are different schools of thought regarding the tax implications of selling a put option on a stock that has been recently disposed. While some interpret that a put option is not \"substantially identical\" to the disposed stock and therefore does not trigger a wash sale, exercising the put option automatically purchases the security, which is identical. It is unclear whether the IRS or brokerage firms recognize the same security when it falls out of an option. However, technically, they could enforce it because the rule is based on 30 days and a \"substantially identical\" stock or security. In this interpretation, it would be wise to choose a strike price out of the money to avoid exercise and to sell an out of the money put to avoid the wash sale trigger. \n\nOn the other hand, a more unfavorable opinion holds that a \"deep in the money\" option immediately triggers a wash sale, regardless of exercise. The Treasury (IRS) may interpret an option transaction within striking distance of being exercisable as a wash sale. If the CUSIPs match, it would trigger a wash sale. Therefore, it is advisable to play it safe and acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities.

However, I am here to help!\n\nThe IRS Publication 17 is a comprehensive guide on filing income taxes. When it comes to reporting royalties, the publication states that royalties from copyrights, patents, and oil, gas, and mineral properties are taxable as regular income. Generally, royalties are reported in Part I of Schedule E (Form 1040). If you hold an operating oil, gas, or mineral interest or are a self-employed writer, inventor or artist, you would report your income and expenses on Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040).\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears that you are receiving royalties from a copyright and not as a self-employed writer. Therefore, you should report the income on Schedule E, Part I. Although I haven't used this form before, I can refer to the instructions which state that you should enter the royalty property as code \u201c6\u201d on Line 1b, Part A. You only need to fill out section A since you only have one royalty property. Then, in column A, Line 4, you should enter the royalties you have received. This is the amount listed on your 1099-MISC.\n\nExpenses deductions may not be applicable in your case, but if you incurred any expenses relating to the production of the income, it would be worth looking into further. On Line 21, you would subtract any applicable expenses (or enter \"0\" if you do not have any expenses to report) and enter the total. Lines 23 and 24 are for accumulating more totals, which in your case should be quite simple as you only have one property. Finally, enter the total again on Line 26, which instructs you to enter it on the main Form 1040, Line 17, and it will be included in your income.\n\nI hope this helps!

To estimate your tax liability, use the rate for your highest tax bracket and apply it to your estimated hobby income, assuming your primary job income won't dramatically increase or decrease compared to last year. Keep in mind that this income will be taxed at your top rate because it is coming on top of your other earnings. Additionally, make sure to clarify whether this is hobby or self-employment income, as self-employment income is subject to self-employment tax in addition to regular income tax."}
{"764": "\n\nRevised: It is important to note that in countries like Canada, oil may contribute a higher percentage to the GDP than in comparison to countries like the US. Thus, the recent drop in oil prices in Canada has resulted in an economic slowdown with oil companies laying off staff, canceling projects, and even potentially going bankrupt, particularly in provinces like Alberta that heavily rely on oil prices driving their economy. Conversely, the US does not have as many energy resources and may not experience the same detrimental effects. However, context is critical, and if the rate change helps everybody, it should include the oil-producing companies. It is plausible that the main reason for lowering rates was due to the significant economic downturn resulting from the drop in oil prices. Therefore, it is imperative to consider that there might be some lingering questions on why the rate cut was necessary if the only significant change considered was the lower oil prices at a macroeconomic level."}
{"765": "\n\nMany of the previous comments have correctly noted the issue of illiquidity. In situations of low liquidity, traders may encounter a large bid/ask spread when trading at odd times - such as when the markets are closed. This is because the other party in the trade cannot immediately offset the risk by going to the market, as they typically do. However, in this particular case, the jump in price is not very significant (approximately 4%), and it is worth noting that the trade price was close to the previous day's closing price. My trading system shows that 5 shares were traded at a similar price that evening. If you were to call me after market hours and tried to purchase 5 shares, I may still have to quote you a higher price due to the illiquidity factor."}

{"768": "\n\nThe effect of Solo 401k contributions on gross income depends on the type of corporation set up. For sole proprietors, both employee and employer contributions are deducted from gross income, without reducing it. On the other hand, S-Corps treat employer contributions as deductions from wages, not showing up in Box 1 on the W-2, thus diminishing gross income. Employee contributions are excluded from Box 1, but appear in Box 3 and 5 for payroll tax purposes. The IRS provides more detailed information on their webpage. Additionally, it's important to note that Gross Income has a unique definition for sole proprietorships, defined by the IRS in publication 501 as all income received in cash, goods, property, or services not excluded from taxes, and any income from investments and incidental or outside operations or sources. Therefore, regardless of 401(k) contributions, gross income is still determined by gross receipts, which for a contractor could be the total on their 1099(s)."}

However, if the payment threshold exceeds $600, the payer must report it to the IRS via a 1099 form. Patreon views each donation as an individual transaction and only files a 1099 form if the donation amount exceeds $20,000 in a calendar year.

Please note that the payer, not the recipient, files a 1099 form.  To register your Patreon income, you can use Schedule C or combine it with the amount on 1040 line 21 (\"other income\"), depending on whether you consider it a business or a hobby.

The good news is that a 401(k) loan is not subject to taxes and can be repaid over a period of 5 years with low interest rates (typically around 4.25%). However, if you leave your job, any outstanding loan balance must be repaid or it will be considered taxable income subject to a 10% penalty. It may be wise to consider using a 401(k) loan to pay off credit card debt.

The bank can offer a higher interest rate on accounts linked with a debit card because they earn additional income through debit card fees charged to account holders and other means. By encouraging people to use their debit cards, the bank assumes that they will maintain a higher balance in their joint checking/savings account, resulting in more money that the bank can loan out or invest, and hence higher profits. Moreover, businesses pay fees to the bank to accept debit cards, which represent another source of income for the bank. Therefore, the bank incentivizes the use of debit cards by offering a higher interest rate or waiving fees on the account.

{"782": "A share of stock typically entitles the owner to all future per-share dividends paid by the company and a fraction of the company's net asset value in case of liquidation. The value of a stock should equal the present cash value of its payout stream if one knew the time and value of all payouts. Usually, people lack clairvoyance to know future payouts, and thus, they estimate the present cash value of future payments to assign a reasonable price for a stock. In a sane marketplace, if the price of a stock is below the estimated current cash value of its payouts, people should buy and push the price up. Conversely, if it is above, people should sell and push the price down. A red flag for a sane marketplace is a rising price, which some bulls may view as the signal to charge ahead. However, buyers should remember that the value of a stock remains the present cash value of future payouts, and they should focus on what the stock will pay out in relation to what they put in. The present price-to-earnings ratio may not always determine a stock's worth as some stocks may pay handsomely next year but not today. Therefore, investors should aim to buy stocks with a reasonable likelihood of paying dividends that justify their cost in the foreseeable future."}

Some large companies have even traded as OTC in the past, such as NYSE:NAV (Navistar) from Feb 2007 to July 2008, due to accounting statement inaccuracies and auditor difficulties. Macromedia, on the other hand, traded on NASDAQ from 13 Dec 1993 until its final day of trading on 2 Dec 2005, having had one stock split (2:1) on 16 Oct 1995 with no dividends ever paid. Some companies can be more challenging to trace, such as the case with bankrupt General Motors (formerly NYSE:GM), which became Motoros Liquidation Corp (OTC:MTLQQ) and traded as such for almost 21 months before being delisted. In mergers, there are typically two entities involved, one surviving and one (or more) that is delisted. In demergers/spinoffs, there can be two entities involved, one that continues the capital structure of the original company and another newly formed spun-off entity. Mere use of company names is not a reliable indication of the company's full history. For example, in 1984, AT&T was forced to spinoff multiple companies due to monopoly considerations, effectively becoming 75% smaller. One of these spinoffs was Southwestern Bell Corporation, which became SBC Communications in 1995. In 2005, SBC took over its former parent company and immediately changed its name to AT&T. As a result, we now have two AT&Ts: one that was delisted in 2005 and another that exists to this day. Disclosure: I am a co-owner of Norgate Data (Premium Data), a data vendor in this area."}

However, it's important to note that you could save a significant amount on this payment by avoiding PMI. To do this, you should aim for a 20% down payment on your next home purchase, which translates to $100,000 for a $500,000 property. If you've only managed to save up $75,000, you have two options: wait until you've saved another $25,000 or refinance your existing property for $95,000 plus an additional $25,000 to reach the required amount. If you choose the latter, you'll end up paying around $575 per month on your current property, assuming a 30-year term at 4% interest. Additionally, if you decide to finance $400,000 for your new property, you can expect monthly payments of approximately $1,900, excluding property tax and home insurance escrow payments.

If a vendor raises the price once you've revealed that it's for a wedding, and you can't justify this with a valid reason, move on to another vendor. Keep in mind that vendors tend to inflate prices for weddings, as they know that people tend to feel sentimental about their special day. Diamonds are another product that are overpriced due to the perceived value rather than actual supply and demand.

Firstly, there is a normal annual deposit limit of $13,000 per parent or donee, which will increase to $14,000 in 2013. This is the gift limit, and unless you anticipate exceeding it, one account may suffice unless both children are in school at the same time, in which case beneficiaries will need to be changed yearly. However, if you plan on depositing gift money, a legal issue arises. The typical 529 allows changes in the beneficiary and, as such, gifts must be held in an irrevocable account for that specific child, such as a UTMA account. A 529 variation known as the UTMA 529 holds no provisions for beneficiary changes; therefore, separate accounts are necessary. In conclusion, a single account causes more issues than it solves. If the amount of gift money is minimal, I recommend keeping it in a regular account. Furthermore, I suggest creating a separate account for relatives' gifts to prevent the risk of theft from one child for the benefit of another. When children are old enough to have earned income, use this money to open and deposit into Roth IRAs, which can help them in the long run without impacting college aid, as a simple savings or brokerage account might."}

However, the difference lies in the cost of those actions. For instance, Registered Market Makers on the BATS stock exchange enjoy enticing rebates and reduced transaction prices, but they have to maintain constant orders in the book for hundreds of equities at significant volumes. Although individual retail traders are permitted to do this, it might be too expensive. Automated trading and algorithmic trading are not the same, and both can range from low- to high-frequency. From a legal or regulatory perspective, there are no unique procedures that an individual retail trader has to follow before automating their trading strategy. Nevertheless, their broker may impose various requirements to use their automation platform. Finally, bid-ask scalping is not recommended for individual retail traders as they are unlikely to succeed against the competition. Successful bidding requires being at the front of the queue continually when the price changes in your favor, and canceling your resting orders when the price changes against you. Unless you have smarter algorithms than those of your competitors, it is challenging to react fast enough. Therefore, achieving direct market access implies forgoing the broker, effectively rendering you no longer a retail trader."}

Although the system is not perfect due to multiple exchanges, this occurrence is rare for equities as most exchanges have orders posted at the NBBO, given they are highly competitive, with nearly identical fee and rebate schedules.

{"805": "\n\nAs an experienced landlord who has managed ten properties for the past 14 years, I have some valuable tips to share. Firstly, it is crucial to have the skills and knowledge required to carry out maintenance tasks as this is your most significant expense. You will be surprised at the amount of maintenance rental units require. Secondly, avoid investing in real estate within areas that favor tenants in disputes such as New York City. Instead, consider states like Florida where evictions can be conducted quickly.\n\nThirdly, require a minimum credit score of 620 for all tenants over the age of 21 to filter out undesirable tenants. Ensure that they have a job nearby that pays at least three times the annual rent every renewal period. Adjust your tenant's rent to be around 5% below the market rate to discourage them from moving to cheaper options but still ensuring profitability.\n\nFourthly, it is wise not to rent to single individuals younger than 30 as they may be more irresponsible and unreliable. However, while this cannot be officially stated, provide other legitimate reasons for rejecting their rental application, such as bad credit or selecting another tenant.\n\nFifthly, introduce a 5% late fee when rent is ten days overdue and prepare to file for eviction when it's 20 days late to indicate your seriousness. When financing your real estate, avoid adjustable rate or balloon loans, only opting for a fixed 30-year rate. This allows for flexibility in payments while ensuring consistent profitability.\n\nSixthly, outsourcing the selection of tenants to a realtor can save time and money. They have a more extensive network to market properties, thus getting a place rented sooner, thus saving expenditure on empty units. Also, ensure that their lease agreement does not mandate continued payments beyond the initial year.\n\nLastly, when investing in multiple properties, it is best to purchase ones within the same community. This facilitates the use of the same lease agreement, vendor list, and paperwork, making management much more efficient. While this contravenes the saying,\" don't put all your eggs in one basket,\" it streamlines day-to-day operations and minimizes expenses."}

Although the Yahoo Query Language (YQL) provides another interface for accessing financial data while enjoying higher rate limits, users might still face limitations. A paid data provider, on the other hand, would likely offer higher thresholds through their API, which is essentially a contract between the provider and user. Additionally, Yahoo Finance is not the most reliable source of financial data, and for research or commercial purposes, data providers such as eSignal, Bloomberg, and Reuters are more popular. Moreover, although Yahoo's current CSV output and YQL resemble standard formats, they are subject to changes that could break many commercial applications that rely on them. However, commercial APIs typically offer technical support to users. Furthermore, Yahoo Finance's licensing terms restrict using their data in commercial apps without using their \"badges\" and obtaining prior written permission from the company. Therefore, using paid data providers becomes a no-brainer, especially for users who require more diverse and accurate data, such as tick-by-tick data for equities, futures, mergers, and derivatives. Lastly, Yahoo's financial statements are known to be inaccurate, partly because data is manually entered. For guaranteed accurate data or supported contracts, users would need to pay for these services."}

It is worth noting that many Canadian residents do not file tax returns. Regardless, the Minister overseeing CRA has the authority to assess taxes on any resident irrespective of their tax filing status. Failing to file a return on time or not filing altogether can result in penalties, which are calculated based on a percentage of the taxes owed. If you do not owe any taxes, then these penalties are irrelevant."}

Assuming three weeks have passed, the current balance is [insert balance]. Inputting this balance into Excel's PMT function, the weekly payment is $189.48. However, if interest doesn't compound, the principal balance would be approximately $8888.37, with a weekly payment of $189.85. It's crucial to note that loan terms can be tailored, so you should ensure that the payment and amortization schedule align with your financial goals before agreeing to the loan. Given the high interest rate, this may be a \"no credit needed\" car loan, notorious for unfavorable borrower terms."}
{"810": "\n\nDetermining whether income from online training is taxable in the US or India is a complex matter dependent on the US-India Tax Treaty. Specifically, Article 15 on Personal Services is of relevance in this case. Your business model will dictate if your online training qualifies as personal services. If your online training is categorized as personal services offered by an Indian resident, it is likely that the income is considered foreign source income under the treaty. However, if your US LLC was subjected to US taxpayer regulations, the LLC would be required to pay US tax on any worldwide income. This could disqualify the LLC from being eligible under Article 15 which applies to individuals and firms of individuals, but not companies. If the LLC is disregarded, the individual owner may be exempt from US tax under the treaty. It is important to note that you may still have an obligation to report nonemployee compensation on Forms 1099 for your workers even if you are exempt from US tax under the tax treaty. If you have failed to file such forms, you may be able to file them late with potential tax consequences for your worker if they have not reported the income in previous years."}
{"811": "\n\nI had a student loan too and it's great to see that you are taking a closer look at the interest rates since it can make a huge difference. One approach that worked for me was to take advantage of a good 0% credit card as my credit improved after leaving school. I applied for a Discover card and was given a decent credit limit. When considering a credit card in this situation, there are two main factors to look for. Firstly, note that the initial $0 transaction charge typically only lasts for a few months, so make sure you take full advantage of this. The benefit of this is that you can pay off your higher interest debt using the 0% offer, which helps you save on interest payments and reduce stress. However, it's important to be aware that you will need to pay off the full amount you owe through the 0% credit card before the offer expires, which could be in a year or 15 months or so. It's crucial to track when the 0% offer will expire, as this is not typically included in the statement and you may need to contact customer service to find out. I personally paid off my balance quickly in a similar situation and I'm sure you'll be able to do the same."}

{"814": "\n\nWhen \"long\" rates are low compared to \"short\" rates, banks tend to make less profit. Banks typically lend money for long-term purposes such as business loans over five years, or mortgages over 30 years. However, they obtain most of their funds from \"short-term\" deposits which can be emptied in a matter of days. Banks profit from the difference between the rates charged on long-term loans and those on short-term loans. In other words, it is the difference between these rates, rather than their individual levels, that determine a bank's profitability. For instance, a bank that pays 1% on certificates of deposit, but lends at 3%, will make money. Banks face the risk of losing profits when short-term rates rise while they still have 30-year loans taken out when rates were lower. For example, when short-term rates began to rise in the 1970s, banks were left with 30-year loans taken out from the earlier part of the decade, at a fixed rate of 7%. This left them with losses, once short-term rates rose to double digits around 1980."}
{"815": "\n\nBoth scenarios require around $10,000 in upfront costs, whether it is for realtor/selling expenses or for fixing up the property for rental. It is important to take into consideration that buyers may request repairs prior to purchase, or request a reduction in price, but for the purposes of this analysis we will ignore those factors. In addition, we will not factor in the remaining mortgage, as it appears that it can be comfortably paid off. Assuming a property management fee of 10% and an average vacancy rate of 10% (depending on your local market), with a rental price of $1,000 per month, we arrive at a conservative estimate of 2.7% ROI. This is relatively low for a rental property. While your wife's rule of thumb of 1% of cash equity generally applies to leveraged rental purchase ROI, rising rental prices in your area could result in this rule being applicable soon. However, it is important to note that this investment will result in locked-in funds. If you are confident in your ability to rent the property and do not lose the tax benefit of selling, the option of a cash-out refinance could be an opportunity to access cash. To maintain a near-zero cash-flow, the cash-out amount should be structured so that payments do not exceed $3,200 per year (i.e.: $266 per month), which would require roughly $50,000 at a 5% fixed rate for a 30-year loan. Ultimately, the decision on what approach to take is up to you, and it is important to consider market stability, potential for large employer loss, and other relevant factors when deciding whether the \"you can always sell\" principle applies to your situation."}
{"816": "\n\nI am expanding on @Dilip's answer to address the additional points in your question, specifically relating to publicly traded stock options on the CBOE. In this context, you are not obligated to exercise a call option and thus do not need to maintain funds on account for potential exercising. Instead, you can let the option expire or resell it, neither of which requires funds to buy the underlying shares.\n\nHowever, if you do choose to exercise the call option, you will be required to fund your account as if you were buying the underlying shares. You should contact your broker to determine the exact rules and timing for this process.\n\nYou cannot cancel an option contract but can sell it to someone willing to buy it on the market. When you sell the option, you can profit or lose money based on the underlying share price, market volatility, and remaining time value. This process puts you back to having \"no position,\" which is not the same as canceling but does remove you from the trade.\n\nOption writers cannot cancel their option but can close out short positions by buying back a matching call option on the market. This process is called a \"buy to close,\" and it can result in profit or loss based on market prices.\n\nClearing is required to match buyers exercising call options with option writers having open short positions. For CBOE options, this clearing is performed by the Options Clearing Corporation, which is the sole issuer of all securities options listed at the CBOE, four other U.S. stock exchanges, and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD). \n\nWhen a call option writer must deliver shares to a call option buyer exercising a call, it's called assignment. This can result in the writer's position being called away, which may lead to a potentially profitable position being lost.\n\nWhile a covered call option writer must own the underlying shares, a naked call option writer does not necessarily need to possess them. However, this strategy is risky and not typically permitted by individual traders' brokers.\n\nYou can learn more about options trading through the Options Industry Council (OIC)."}
{"817": "\n\nBecoming an accredited investor is challenging for an ordinary person unless they change their career. Earning any legal certification in investments necessitates sponsorship from an investment company that one works for. Due to various reasons, these investments are usually not directly available to regular people. Therefore, it is wise to seek counsel from a registered investment adviser (RIA) before investing in something that lacks standardized features traded on a significant exchange. This investment field tends to be non-standardized; hence, advisers and investment managers with proper training can comprehend non-standard investments, evaluate legal documents, and make informed decisions. They ensure investors avoid pyramid schemes. Startup investments present numerous issues such as how much of the company or profit one is qualified for, restrictions on paying dividends, and the investment's liquidity. Some startup investment agreements have clauses that make the investment worthless. It is unlikely for a startup to go public, so investors must seek an RIA's service to invest their money for better returns. Overall, the restrictions exist to safeguard regular folks from making poor investment choices. Working with an RIA is easier, less risky, and not much more expensive."}

However, the ability to have voting rights without economic exposure, known as empty voting, is a crucial difference.

{"820": "\n\nRevised: True blue preferred shares are considered hybrid securities, combining characteristics of credit and equity. They have seniority over common equity in bankruptcy liquidation, but their dividend payout is not mandatory. Financial institutions are the main issuers of preferred shares as they offer greater flexibility than bonds, without diluting common equity too much. Preferred shares are credit-like securities that generate income through fixed, yet potentially unpredictable, dividends. They tend to behave more like bonds, rising when interest rates fall and vice versa, and their price variances are more similar to bonds than common equities. If a company stops paying the preferred dividend or faces financial difficulties, the price of the preferred share is likely to decline. However, there are newer types of preferred shares, such as convertible preferred shares, which are based on common equity derivatives and therefore have greater volatility."}

However, for families facing simultaneous financial and emotional distress, seeking religious guidance may prove helpful in finding ways to remember their loved ones through means other than expensive funerals, which could ultimately reduce their insurance costs. Surprisingly, larger life insurance policies may be more suitable for children. After all, what is the cost of replacing a child? For families with only one son or daughter, losing that child would mean losing an obvious part of their cultural and genetic legacy, which can be both emotionally and financially taxing. Bearing and raising a child to adulthood is an expensive responsibility, and the cost increases with each passing year. Moreover, conceiving another child can be a significant financial burden, especially if fertility treatments or sterilization reversal surgery is required. Regrettably, most insurance companies fail to recognize these complexities, and policies ranging between $100,000 to $250,000 for children are not readily available."}
{"823": "\n\nThe name of a Gilt indicates its redemption date, but not the original issue date. A Gilt offering 8.75% yield and nearing its redemption date may have been initially offered when interest rates were close to 8.75%. For instance, in the early 1990s, the inflation rate in the UK was approximately 8%. When selecting high or low coupon Gilt, one must weigh the trade-off between capital gains and income and how it impacts taxation. Should you hold a Gilt until its maturity date, you have the advantage of knowing the exact redemption price, which is \u00a3100. When making an investment, you may prefer to receive a high level of income now with the knowledge that there will be a capital loss in the future. Conversely, you may elect not to take any income, choosing instead to realize a guaranteed capital gain later on, such as when you retire from work. Additionally, you can utilize changes in market values of Gilts as a means of gambling or hedging against your predictions of future interest rate variations. With a 'government-guaranteed' fallback position, you will receive an exact return on the Gilt should your predictions turn out to be incorrect.

While analyzing investments, it is essential to understand the industry's standards for debt/equity, margin, cash-on-hand, and gearing, as well as assessing competitors' barriers to entry. High margins may not always indicate success, and they can easily be undermined by competitors. Companies offering continually high returns may be operating a Ponzi scheme, like Bernie Maddof.

While the tax code does not specifically address house flipping, there is a distinction between a flipper and an investor. The difference is comparable to that between a trader and an investor. The revenue generated from house flipping can be classified as either active business gain or passive activity income, each of which is treated differently. Income from passive activities is reported on Schedule E and Schedule D, whereas income from active activities is reported on Schedule C. The differentiation between passive and active is dependent on the nature of the activity and the time invested in it. Trading income can likewise be categorized as passive or active. Certain special rules apply to traders in securities, who engage in buying and selling securities for their own accounts. Although traders do not maintain inventories or have customers, this activity is still considered a business. To be a trader in securities, you must meet certain conditions. Whether your activity is classified as a securities trading business or not is dependent on various factors, which can be discussed with a tax professional. If your trading activity does not qualify as a business, you will be classified as an investor, which means passive income treatment (Schedule D/E). However, even if your income is classified as active (Schedule C), sale proceeds from stocks are not subject to self-employment tax.

Thus, your mother may now hold sole ownership of the account. It may be wise to consult with the bank to obtain free advice. Additionally, it is worth considering the classification of the account since your father's passing. A power of attorney can grant broad or limited authority; in this case, it is likely that your mother held general POA, allowing her to act in her husband's stead.

Remember to \"Buy Low, Sell High\"; many investors make the mistake of pulling out of long-term investments at the first sign of a downturn, resulting in buying high and selling low.\n\nIt's important to note that, as the end of the year approaches, many stock funds will declare dividends and capital gains distributions, resulting in potential taxes on your 2012 tax return. This is known as \"buying a dividend.\" To avoid this, spend time researching now, but make your investment in late December after your chosen fund has made its distributions, as indicated on the fund's website. Alternatively, you can wait until early 2013 to invest."}
{"847": "\n\nThe situation in Australia is similar to what the US faced during the crash, with individuals taking on debt despite poor credit ratings and the inability to pay. The issue lies not in the debt itself, but in how effectively individuals can service their debt with their limited disposable income. Additionally, banks must consider how they will collect money from borrowers who default. In the US, individuals have the option to refinance their debt or default, causing banks to hedge their risks. If this is also an option in Australia, there may be a crash. Otherwise, there is no need to worry. Continued lending by banks could result in higher inflation and interest rates, as well as a possible downgrade in government-issued bonds. However, there may be a boost in exports due to a devalued Australian dollar and increased import costs."}

However, it takes practice for these concepts to truly sink in and, let's be honest, it can be a bit dry for kids who may not be interested. Instead, consider setting up an account on Mint with them, which will help them stay aware of their finances. Mint also provides a variety of videos that teach basic personal finance. If you want to go deeper and teach your children about the techniques and methods behind creating and maintaining a personal ledger or journal, as well as reconciling it against a bank account, you'll be getting into material that undergraduates study. The good news is that there are plenty of first-year textbooks available second-hand, usually for very cheap.\n\nBut ultimately, what matters most is mindset. Keeping financial records and managing money is easy with the right approach. Demonstrate this to your children by keeping your own finances in order and showing them how you organize and file bills, credit cards, and other financial documents. This way, they will learn the importance of keeping financial records and will be more likely to understand this concept when it is discussed in the future. Emphasize the importance of living within your means, which is the key to financial stability, even if they don't understand the finer points of bookkeeping or other accounting concepts."}

High-frequency traders could exploit these markets because of the difference in exchange fees. As a result, orders are queued up in a sequence and processed based on price-time priority to avoid crossed or locked markets. The first order to cross the market will be matched with the best oldest opposing order. Crossed or locked markets are considered unfair by regulators.

Convertible instruments tend to move in the same direction as the underlying stock but with less volatility and volume, making them suitable for hedging against the stock going up. Bonds and preference shares are higher on the list to be repaid in case of bankruptcy and offer fixed interest payouts that can protect against potential problems with a long position in the common stock. The plan is to earn fixed income from bonds as the stock price drops, sell both bonds and buy back the stock to cover the short position. If the stock rises instead, fixed income from bonds can still be earned and be converted into stock at a higher price to cover the short sale, reducing losses. The profit comes from the price spread and the fixed income is less volatile than stock, except for the junk market."}

{"865": "Investing in stocks can be challenging, and one of the most difficult parts is knowing when to sell. Predictions about a company's earnings, made by knowledgeable and honest experts, are constantly being released, yet it takes time to determine whether these predictions will come true. To make investment choices, the public has access to financial information, called fundamental analysis, which investment firms regularly use. However, in an efficient market, all public information is immediately factored into the stock's price. Therefore, investing using a single piece of information involves high risk because other factors affect stock value over time. Investment firms have teams of researchers and years of experience in the sector, and individuals should be cautious when picking individual stocks. If investing in equities or small startups, the risk increases. Furthermore, investing in a newly public company \u2013 with an initial public offering (IPO) \u2013 involves additional risks: the company must calculate the best price point for the public, and sometimes the stock price drops on the first day. To invest, people should research the industry, the company, and the experts as much as possible before putting money into it. The analogy of buying a car highlights the importance of knowing all the details before making a decision - investing money works similarly. Therefore, while there is money to be made in individual stock investing, only those who have a thorough understanding of the industry and the details typically make significant gains."}

While the daily settlement price is based on mark-to-market values, the final settlement price is determined by averaging reported prices from Dubai and Oman, or by using a known procedure in certain cases. This price is then converted to Yen using reference bank-published monthly average exchange rates. It is recommended to use the original Oman and Dubai prices unless there is a specific aim to arbitrage the TOCOM market.

Smart people realized they could buy them cheap in summer and sell them when the prices went up, and more people caught on, making easy money.

{"879": "\n\nWhile it is not obligatory to use a broker, it is highly recommended. The requirements for lawyers or escrow companies may vary by county, so it is advisable to verify the local regulations. Typically, escrow companies are necessary to obtain title insurance, secure financing, and negotiate the price. Agents are legally obligated to be knowledgeable about the process and can guide clients through crucial steps such as reading inspection reports, requesting seller disclosures and information, obtaining HOA documents and disclosures, and negotiating prices based on market information like comparable sales and listings. While attempting to navigate this alone is possible, it would be a challenging endeavor that could result in missing essential steps and costly issues in the future. Using an agent will typically result in a 5% commission fee, and if the process is completed without one, a discount of approximately 5% on the property's market value can be expected.

It's currently December and one option may be to sell half of what is desired now and the other half in January to divide the tax burden over two years. Are there any additional strategies for reducing taxes in this situation? One possibility is to sell stocks that have decreased in value since purchasing. This should only be done if the belief in the stock's potential has changed and it is no longer worth holding onto. When selling stocks, any losses can offset gains. For example, selling one stock for a gain of $10,000 and another for a loss of $5,000 would result in being taxed on only the $5,000 net gain. It is possible to sell the decreasing stock to realize the loss and purchase it later at a lower price, as long as it is not a concern that it may increase during that time. However, it is important to wait at least 30 days before repurchasing to avoid the wash sale rules. This technique is known as tax loss harvesting."}

The question is, can you pay off your student loans quickly and then have the discipline to invest at least as much, if not more, as you were putting towards your loans? While many people are good at paying bills on time and in full, they may struggle to prioritize investing in themselves. As @Brandon mentioned, it is possible to do both. This approach makes practical sense, promotes good habits, boosts confidence, and diversifies your investment portfolio. Personally, I have been making double payments on my student loans while also maxing out my IRA, HSA, & 401k. In addition, I have a rental property, but that's another topic altogether.

{"885": "\n\nThe Motley Fool article correctly states that if you earn over $1000 in UBTI, you must pay taxes on it, even if it is held in an IRA. C-corps do not generate UBTI, so they are not a concern. The most common non-C-corps are REITs, MLPs, and BDCs. REITs typically invest in either real estate property or mortgages. mREITs, which invest in mortgages, can occasionally generate UBTI. However, this should not deter investors from considering them since they can be a great source of income and best held in an IRA, which is tax-free. Some examples of mREITs are NLY, CIM, and AGNC, while property REITs include O, SNR, OHI, and EQR.\n\nMLPs, like REITs, are pass-through entities but can issue complex K-1 forms during tax time. Holding MLPs in an IRA can be more convenient to avoid these complications, given that the UBTI generated does not exceed $1000. Examples of MLPs include MAIN, MCC, and ARCC.\n\nBDCs are also pass-through entities that give income taxed at the ordinary income bracket if held in a taxable account. Examples of BDCs include MAIN, MCC, and ARCC. Consulting their 10-K reports can help assess the risk of UBTI.

{"886": "\n\nIn economics/finance, a well-known correlation is that stock prices and bond yields have an inverse relationship. As stock prices rise, bond yields generally fall, indicating a strong credit risk and resulting in a decreased yield to maturity for bonds in the market. While correlations between the stock and futures markets may be apparent in actual price histories, it is more likely that various future prices have correlations with specific companies' stocks. When the price of a raw material, which is a significant cost of goods sold for a company, rises, the prices of futures for that material and those of the company's stock may move inversely in the short term. If there is a causative relationship here, it is more likely that futures prices influence stock prices, rather than the other way around. The futures market often indicates the cost side of the bottom line for consumer goods producers, while the stock market represents profits. Thus, futures going up may pressure stock prices down as profit expectations decrease. Indirectly, even industries dealing in services or other goods can be affected as consumers may reduce spending in other areas when the cost of a needed commodity rises. Companies adapt to changing costs by gradually increasing prices or using less expensive materials, restructuring production processes or even moving factories offshore. These measures can reduce costs, increase profits and lower demand for the commodity, causing futures prices to drop. Long-term market variations, however, are more affected by factors such as inflation, consumer/investor confidence and monetary policies."}

Financial planning is subjective, and it is up to individuals to determine their financial goals. My number one rule is to never spend what I do not have. I do not agree with the reflection that one should always pay off their credit card at the end of each month. Why not spend from savings and plan monthly expenditures before spending on \"wants?\" By doing so, one can avoid credit card debt altogether. Once expenses are under control, an emergency fund should be established. The amount saved depends on individual circumstances and may be equal to six months of monthly income. Investing should only occur after an emergency fund is established, and health insurance should be secured before venture into investments for returns.

Depending on the information you want to track, you could set it up in various ways. One solution is to create virtual sub-accounts of your assets and record the source of money instead of the destination. This way, when you generate an expense report, you can limit it to \"his\" or \"hers\" asset accounts and see only the expenses that pertain to those accounts. You can apply the same logic to liabilities and credit cards. If, on the other hand, you're more interested in a running sum of expenses, instead of creating \"Me\" and \"Spouse\" accounts at every leaf of the expense tree, it would make more sense to create top-level expense accounts for \"Expenses: His: etc.\" and \"Expenses: Hers: etc.\" For each of your spending, you can then create sub-expense accounts, matching account structures for common accounts."}

These reports are future-oriented and forecast the value for those within the company. On the other hand, financial accounting is primarily used by individuals outside of a company or organization. Financial reports are generated for set periods of time, such as a fiscal year or period, and are historically factual with predictive value for those who wish to make financial decisions or investments in the company.\n\nAt my university, managerial accounting focused on managing costs within a company, forecasting for the future of the business, and other relevant details, whereas financial accounting was approached from the perspective of a financial analyst or investor. The financial accounting course material included analysis of financial statements and the associated investment decisions, among other topics. These areas do overlap in certain areas such as the production of financial statements, which must also take into account how analysts will interpret them, as well as considerations such as dividend policy and corporate tax accounting. \n\nPlease note that my knowledge of these course structures is based on my introductory accounting course at university, and there may be more similarities and differences of which I am not aware.

However, PayPal changed this policy around 2011 to ensure person-to-person payments were free (except for credit card charges), while merchants were charged for receiving payments. This change decoupled payment types from account types, so now any account can receive both person-to-person and payment-for-goods-or-services transactions, with the former not incurring fees and the latter incurring fees, regardless of the account type."}

{"905": "\n\nThere are multiple methods for calculating returns, and each method may result in different percentage values. However, one straightforward way to calculate returns is by counting the cash. For instance, let's say you started with $977 and ended up with $1,370, which indicates a profit of $363. But what about the percentage return? One approach is to assume that you invested $1 in a fund. To determine the value of the fund at the beginning and the end, you need to consider the cash and share values. \n\nHowever, in your example, there is a complication. You added new capital to the fund, which can distort the return. Initially, you invested $977, which increased to $1,473 in the second period. Later, you sold off 200 shares for $950, which left you with $1,473 split between $950 in cash and $523 in shares. At this point, you can easily calculate the return as (1,473 / 977 - 1 = 50.8%). \n\nNext, you bought shares worth $981, but you only had $950 in cash. Two scenarios arise. Either you or someone else injected $31 into the fund. If you already had the cash in the fund, then your initial investment was $1,008 instead of $977 (977 in shares and $31 in cash). At the end, the value of the fund was $1,370, which means your return was 1,370 / 1,007 = 36%. However, if an outsider injected the $31, you need to recalculate the ownership of the fund. Before the injection, the fund was worth $950 in cash and $387 in stock, which equals $1,339. After the injection, the value of the fund increased to $1,370. Thus, the ownership of the fund is split: 97.8% for the old capital and 2.2% for the new capital. If the value of the fund changes, you can compute the return for each investor based on their share of the fund's worth relative to their investment. \n\nSuppose you injected the $31; you need to calculate the weight of each share of capital in each period to calculate the return for each period and obtain the total return. In this case, the return is 37.2% for the original investment, but it becomes even more complex for each new capital injection."}

{"907": "\n\nHealth insurance costs can vary significantly depending on the state, plan, and provider. Nevertheless, it is essential to research and compare these costs to have an idea of the expenses you would incur if you had to purchase insurance on your own. In addition, when considering employment offers, keep in mind the vacation time provided, particularly in contract or compensation-only positions where such benefits may not be offered. For instance, the prospect of having no vacation time may elevate the worth of an equivalent package that includes, say, 10 or 15 days off annually. It's also worthwhile to determine whether a compensation-only position offers overtime, and whether that has to be approved. Similarly, it's necessary to confirm whether a salaried position that includes benefits will demand more than a standard 40-hour workweek. If doing the latter, it's a good idea to seek the opinion of others who work for that company. While an offer that compensates for overtime may seem more appealing, it could be less desirable if it does not include paid time off."}

{"909": "\n\nAlthough it may seem like a good way to manage long-term cumulative interest, there are some important things to consider when maxing out credit cards. A major downside is that it can severely harm your credit rating, and you may stop receiving reasonable credit offers altogether. Even with a high income, it is easy to overshoot the 8 months allotted to pay off the balance, resulting in a high interest rate due to the low credit rating. Additionally, maxing out your credit cards can cause lenders to cut your limits or demand early payment, which can be financially disastrous. Even once you reach month 6, your payment obligations may suddenly skyrocket, putting you at greater risk of missing a payment and further damaging your credit score. Ultimately, the potential risks of decimating your financial structure outweigh any benefits. Instead, if you are confident in your ability to pay off $4,000 in 8 months, it is wiser to apply those payments directly to your student loans, eliminating the middleman. This will also benefit your credit score by reducing your total liabilities and keeping your utilization rate low, increasing your chances of being offered more credit at lower rates. A good rule of thumb is to maintain a credit utilization rate of 10%, making it wise to use that portion to repay your student loans. Building up your credit score will provide a cushion for financial emergencies and allow you to finance a larger home with lower mortgage interest rates."}
{"910": "\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the specific location is often diversified out of the fund. This is because major building or real estate companies attempt to spread the risk by investing in multiple geographic locations. Furthermore, buyers of smaller portfolios may create larger funds which are sold to the general public in order to further diversify. However, it is possible to identify the specific assets held by a real estate fund, although this requires considerable effort. Another way to determine the geographic focus of a fund is to examine the issuer of the bonds issued by the construction or real estate company. I hope this information is helpful."}
{"911": "\n\nIf you believe that the housing market is correlated with major stock indices, you can hedge against the depreciation of your house price. To do this, consult a commodities broker who can guide you in purchasing puts on stock indices. This will offer some form of protection if housing prices decrease. For instance, if weak economic conditions cause house prices to plummet by 30%, stocks will likely also experience a 30% drop. With adequate exposure to puts compared to your house's value, you can safeguard your investment. Additionally, consider buying 30-year bond calls for interest rate lock if you have a variable interest rate. Investors such as Warren Buffet and Carl Icahn have protected themselves by taking these measures in anticipation of a potential market downturn. However, it is essential to seek advice from a full-time commodity broker, not discount brokers or online trading platforms like E-Trade.

{"912": "\n\nCertain builders will proactively fix problems at no charge to homeowners if they are informed of the problem before a bill is presented. This demonstrates good faith, and my own home was built by such a builder. If I am capable of identifying and resolving a problem myself, then I will pay for it out of my own pocket. However, if it's beyond my expertise, I'll reach out to the builder or subcontractor for assistance, and I am willing to pay for any diagnoses or repairs if necessary. I contact my preferred plumber for plumbing issues, and although I pay for their work, there have been two instances where their repairs were unsuccessful, and the builder or subcontractor fixed the problem at no additional cost to me due to installation or testing errors related to building inspections.\n\nRegarding the diagnosis and repair work you described, I had a similar experience with my builder's subcontractor replacing prematurely damaged shingles on my roof that prevented a leak caused by a tree that couldn't be trimmed back due to the building permit. It appears to be a recurring issue. In my opinion, the alleged problem with the roof pitch is a design flaw that should have been evident during house design, and it will likely require correction within your remodeling budget. Without further details, it's doubtful that the builder or homeowners' insurance company is liable for it. Some builders may try to minimize their warranty work to save money, but I'm not sure what kind of builder you have. Your lawyer can inform you if statutes of limitations apply, and starting a lawsuit could ruin your relationship with your builder.\n\nLastly, many homeowners' insurance companies use a cumulative number of claims made historically at each property address to set rates, regardless of which company or homeowner filed them. I'm unsure if claims older than a certain number of years or the first claim are ignored by any insurance companies."}
{"913": "\n\nThe following is based on my years of experience with Experian credit scoring in the UK. Please note that there may be some differences in your case due to your location, but the following should provide some general guidelines. Currently, my credit score is 999, the highest possible, and I have 6 credit cards.\n\nWhile having many active credit accounts can be seen as negative, having many settled accounts should have a positive effect on your credit score. As long as you keep your accounts settled, having another card should not be detrimental and can be beneficial over time. However, having a large total credit balance outstanding may count against you, unless your total outstanding debt on all credit accounts is a smaller proportion of your total available credit. This means that having more cards for the same amount of credit used, is overall beneficial. More cards also reduce the percentage of outstanding credit as a proportion of your total available credit, indicating lower risk to lenders.\n\nBased on my experience, the higher the highest credit limit on a single card you have, while managing it responsibly, the better. Late payments count against you, so setting up a direct debit for the minimum amount every month can help. Lenders favour consistent payers. \n\nNew credit accounts initially count against you, but as they age and are managed responsibly, they eventually count in your favour and increase your score. However, making many credit applications in a short space of time may count against you as you may be seen as credit reliant.\n\nOverall, getting another card is recommended for more flexibility and options. Even though your credit score might decrease slightly for a couple of months, it will eventually increase based on the above guidelines. Having more cards available means you can choose the cheapest lender for any outstanding debts you have. In the UK, credit card companies offer \"interest-free\" or 0% \"balance transfer\" offers that can be quite cheap credit. However, remember to avoid pitfalls such as missing payments, using cards specifically for balance transfers, and paying off balances as cheaply as possible."}
{"914": "\n\nDo you know if your employer follows standard withholding procedures? If so, you can determine which tax bracket you fall into after all normal deductions have been considered. For example, if this puts you in the 25% bracket, then your estimated tax would be the result of multiplying your freelance income, minus business expenses, by 25%, with the caveat that this might change if your income pushes you into another bracket. Additionally, for incomes between $90,000 and $118,500, you need to account for approximately 12-13% of Social Security/Medicare contributions. Filling out Form 1040SSE can give you a better estimate, but there's also a \"safe harbor\" provision. This provision means that if you pay as much in estimated tax as you did the previous year, you won't be penalized.

Once you retire, consider rolling over your 401(k) into an IRA account, which can be created through online brokerage firms like Schwab, E-Trade, or Sharebuilder, or through brick-and-mortar firms like JP Morgan and Stifel Nicolaus. Start by determining how much money you need each month for expenses, accounting for inflation and estimating the amount you'll need at the age you plan to retire. Calculate how much money you'll need in savings in order for 4.5% of that money to cover your annual living expenses, and aim to reach that target amount. Rule #1 is to invest early and invest often, as early investment has more time to grow. If you don't feel comfortable managing your investments, consider a Targeted Retirement Fund which allocates your assets appropriately based on the time left till retirement."}
{"916": "\n\nFinancial emergencies can manifest in various ways, such as hefty medical expenses, losing employment, being sued, or incurring significant vehicle or home repairs, among others. While some individuals may have a slim probability of facing financial emergencies, such as those who live in nations with comprehensive health plans, reside with their parents who can handle home repairs or transportation, and do not own a car, others may have likely scenarios where they could require an emergency fund. In my case, I find it essential to establish an emergency fund since I support my children's college education. If I lose my employment, unemployment benefits might not suffice to support their education. Additionally, my subpar health insurance could lead to substantial medical bills, and my aging car might need costly repairs or require replacement. I might even find myself charged with a crime falsely and require legal representation. Since everyone's situation is different, unforeseen events can transpire, and it is impossible to list every unforeseeable problem. Therefore, it is crucial to always have an emergency fund, regardless of how safe one thinks they are. It is challenging to determine how much to save, but it is always better to have a cushion for just in case moments."}

However, I think you overlooked one important factor - your profit or loss is not just based on the monthly rental income. Your profit also takes into account the property value after the mortgage is paid off. Even if you need to invest an additional $100 each month because the rent is lower than the mortgage, maintenance, and taxes, in 30 years, the property could be worth $200k while you only paid $36k ($100/month for 30 years).

{"923": "\n\nRevised:\n\nIt's worth noting that while you're not required to write the date received on the back of a check, it can be a helpful precaution. For instance, if a customer who owes you money sends a check that's postdated for the due date but arrives well past it, having a record of when you received the check can be useful in the future. When you deposit or cash a check, an image of the front and back is created and stored by the bank, and this can include any notes you add to the back of the check. So, write the date received next to your endorsement, endorse the check, and take a photo of both sides along with the envelope's postmark to document the customer's tardiness. This way, if there's ever confusion or a dispute down the line, you'll be able to easily demonstrate the pattern of late payment. While this may seem like a lot of effort for a rare scenario, it's a precaution that can prove invaluable in protecting your business. I've found it helpful to do this a few times over the past 20 years, particularly with customers who are habitually late, and in one instance, it proved to be a huge advantage when I needed to provide evidence of repeated poor payment practices."}

{"926": "\n\nRevised: The issuance of bonus shares also enhances liquidity; however, there are differences in their treatment. For instance, let's assume a company has 100 shares worth $10 each, which capitalizes to $1000. Assuming the company is performing well, its shares are now trading at $100 each in the market. If the company earned a profit of $1000, this sum would also factor in the share price of $100. If the company chose to retain this profit as Cash Reserve without distributing it as dividends, in a share split, such as (1:1), the book value of each share would decrease to $5, and the number of shares would increase to 200, while the share capital would remain at $1000. Consequently, the market value of shares would drop to $50 each. Alternatively, in a Bonus share issue, such as (1:1), the $1000 funds would be transferred from Cash Reserve to share capital, the book value of each share would remain at $10, the number of shares would increase to 200, and the share capital would increase to $2000. As a result, the market value of shares would decrease to $50 each. Both options have comparable benefits regarding liquidity. However, why some companies choose bonus shares over a split varies for several reasons. Firstly, a split cannot be done beyond a certain point, for instance, $10 could be split into $1 each, but it does not make sense to make it $0.50 or lower. Secondly, when there is adequate cash reserve, companies may want to convert it into shareholders' capital to improve some of the health ratios for the company. Finally, companies may use bonus shares to entice investors with the idea of receiving something free."}
{"927": "\n\nBased on your description, you won't be double-taxed. Partners are usually taxed on distributions, which are considered as income. However, your gain in the partnership is not income. You invested some money in the partnership, and you need to pay tax on that amount, but not on the gain. The tax question is whether you're being double-taxed in another way. The text doesn't explain how you invested, but the options are a payroll deduction or another payment. If it was a payroll deduction, you've already paid taxes via your W2. If you received a 1099, it suggests it was not a payroll deduction, but you should double-check. \n\nRegarding the discrepancy in the numbers, your shares in the partnership likely transacted before the partnership valuation, affecting the gain. For example, if the partnership was worth $1000 with 100 outstanding shares, and you put up $1000 and got 100 shares, the partnership would then be worth $2000 with 200 outstanding shares. If it's then valued at $3000, your gain is $1500. If the valuation went down, your gain would be less than your initial investment. If your shares transacted immediately after the valuation, your gain and cost would be the same. Double-check if your shares transacted after the valuation, and if so, there needs to be an explanation for the difference in your gain. \n\nFinally, the gain boxes on your K1 track your capital basis in case the partnership sells. You'll get some money from the sale which will be taxed; how much depends on what you received versus what the company was worth, and whether your gain was long or short-term. Read up more on partnerships and K1, not just the IRS publications, which can be dense and difficult to understand. Good luck, and congratulations!"}

Though your bank balance may remain intact (though recent events in Cyprus suggest otherwise), it is unclear whether FDIC insurance will be upheld in the event of a bank default, which may occur as a result of a ripple effect and lead to financial loss.

For more savings options, consider opening a regular brokerage account and invest in diversified, low-cost funds with minimum expense ratios. Don't invest in funds where the 12b-1 fee is prominent. Opt to purchase low-cost index funds from Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab or similar competitors as they offer instant diversification, instead of gambling with mutual funds. The Bogleheads forum offers more comprehensive advice on suggested investment strategies like the lazy portfolios, which are more specific. Smartly buy and sell your investments in a tax-smart way to benefit your tax returns. Sell your poor-performing stocks at the end of the year and use the loss as a tax write-off. Rebalance to a more practical portfolio. Alternatively, sell your winners at a low tax-rate when your tax bracket is very low. Attempt to hold on to assets for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains instead of short-term ones. Once you have several million dollars, then you can consider investing in individual investments instead of funds. With a non-tax-advantaged account, owning assets directly may benefit you by writing off losses against your taxes. However, transaction costs of maintaining portfolios are still higher than fees charged by cheap mutual or index funds."}

My approach involves working in Sydney and purchasing a property there (which I did six years ago). I intend to benefit from Sydney's insane growth and allow my property to appreciate. In the past six years, my property has appreciated by 76%, even during an economic downturn. As soon as the equity in the property reaches a certain point, I will invest in additional properties on an interest-only home loan and rent them out. I plan to build a diverse property portfolio as quickly as possible.\n\nOnce I decide to retire, I will sell off the investment properties and purchase a residence outside of Sydney where the cost of living is more affordable. By then, my original property will be paid off, and I will be able to rent it out for additional income to support me in retirement.

{"936": "\n\nThe necessary coverage for your situation will depend on a variety of factors which are not clear from the question posed. While the coverage for vacant homes is typically referred to as \"Vacant home insurance,\" not all insurance companies are willing to offer this coverage. In New York, it is also possible for standard homeowners' coverage to be legally discontinued by insurers if they become aware that the property has been vacant for 30 days or more. \n\nInsurance companies are often concerned about the risks of break-ins, squatters, and vandalism in vacant properties, leading to an exclusion clause for such properties in standard homeowners' policies. Companies use risk models to calculate the estimated risks related to vacant properties, making seasonal vacation homes in sparsely populated areas a lower risk than family homes in urban areas. If the estimated risk is low, some insurance companies may allow homeowners to buy back the exclusion and include coverage for vacant properties. \n\nTo insure your vacant property, you will need to find a company willing to accept the additional risk associated with a vacant home. Farmer's and Castle Rock are two companies known for offering coverage for vacant homes, although many insurance agencies are middlemen that utilize one of these companies to provide coverage. Since vacant property coverage is specialized, it's important to understand the policy details and any differences from standard policies. \n\nWays to reduce the cost of additional coverage include using security systems, installing temperature-monitoring sensors, and hiring traditional house-sitters to prevent break-ins, plumbing issues, or other problems that may occur in an unoccupied property. If possible, it may also be beneficial to find someone trustworthy like a friend or relative to occupy the property rent-free, ensuring the property remains in pristine condition for potential buyers. For specific questions or advice related to your unique situation, consider consulting with an independent insurance broker. \n\nBest of luck obtaining coverage for your vacant property and quickly selling it."}

However, you need excellent credit to qualify. While most loans for a specific amount and term have lower rates if secured with collateral, SunTrust\u2019s unsecured loan is an exception. The major advantage is getting cash before you buy, making negotiations with the dealer easier. Bear in mind, however, that SunTrust may ultimately require proof of purchase using the loan proceeds.\n\nFor debt consolidation loans, SunTrust\u2019s rates range from 5.49%-11.24%, with the lowest rates only available to those with excellent credit. It\u2019s possible that if your credit isn\u2019t excellent, your rate could rise quickly. Still, a rate of 4.24% for the worst auto loan is lower than the 5.49% for the best debt consolidation loan.\n\nNote that LightStream, which offers SunTrust\u2019s unsecured auto loan, believes there is no single definition for \u201cexcellent credit,\u201d but individuals with excellent credit usually share certain characteristics.

Investing in local markets enables you to gain a better understanding of such changes and minimizes risks, as well as being cost-effective and transaction-efficient. Diversification in investment should also involve careful consideration of how much to allocate to equities, debt, bullion, and real estate. Once you have invested in sizable amounts of equity or debt, diversification via funds from other regions makes more sense.

{"951": "\n\nAs previously mentioned, the solution for trading with larger amounts is using margin. Here's how it works: You deposit, let's say, 1'000 USD with your trading company who provides you with a margin of, say, 1:100, enabling you to trade with 100'000 USD. For instance, you can purchase 5'000 shares of a stock at $20 USD, fully utilizing your limit of 100'000 USD. If the price increases to $20.50, you make a profit of 5000 x $0.50 = $2'500. However, if the stock price briefly dips to $19.80 before rising, you will experience a loss of 5000 x $0.2 = $1'000, and this may cause you to receive an email from your broker stating that your shares have been sold at $19.80 (margin call or termination notice). This is because brokers willingly grant you credit, knowing they will have no risk of loss. Although you will be charged interest on the funds you use for trading, it will only be for a few minutes. Therefore, to answer your question, you need not concern yourself with when you will receive your money back because the trading company will offer you more as long as you have a deposit left. However, it is pertinent to note that using extremely high margins offered by some brokers, such as 1:100, can be a disastrous idea, and a lower margin of 1:10 could be a safer choice."}

However, if the market price deviates significantly from the net asset value (NAV) of the ETF, an Authorized Participant (AP) can create or redeem shares to push the market price back towards NAV. Therefore, we can expect the price to track NAV, as long as the markets are functioning and the APs are active.\n\nWhen it comes to bond ETFs, the NAV can decrease when the market interest rate rises. For example, if the current market interest rate is 2% and an ETF invests in 10-year T-notes with a 2% coupon at par, with a market value of $100m and 1m shares worth $100 each, and the interest rate goes up to 3%, the ETF's value will decrease to $90. This is because no one wants to pay par for a bond with a lower interest rate when they can get a better rate elsewhere. If the ETF sells the old bonds and buys new 3% bonds, the fund would only have a par value of $90m instead of $100m, so the NAV remains at $90.\n\nIf the ETF holds the 2% bonds until maturity, the NAV will increase as the discount of the bonds decreases, assuming the market interest rate stays the same. However, the investor would have forgone the opportunity to invest elsewhere and earn more interest, effectively making the original share price of $90 correct."}

{"976": "\n\nFirstly, I want to clarify that there is nothing extraordinary about a self-managed investment portfolio versus one managed by a professional. With some exceptions, you are capable of putting together a portfolio that is identical to what a professional could assemble for you. Additionally, this can often be done at a lower cost, which is a critical factor in determining how your portfolio will perform over time. \n\nDiversification refers to the practice of not putting all of your eggs in one basket. This means that by spreading your investments in a manner that reduces overall risk, you can reduce the likelihood of everything moving in the same direction at the same time. This spread can include investments that have different underlying risks in various sectors of the economy, spread across different countries, and diverse investment types (such as company stock, corporate bonds, government bonds, and precious metals).\n\nRisk in investment is typically measured through volatility, which describes how much a stock's price fluctuates over a specific period. A more volatile stock is riskier because its fall could lead to a more significant percentage of your investment being lost compared to a stock that is less volatile. \n\nIt is crucial to note that a well-diversified portfolio tends to perform better over time than a poorly diversified portfolio. A poorly diversified portfolio is typically limited to specific geographical regions, sectors of the economy, or types of investments. Although a poorly diversified portfolio could outperform a more diversified portfolio in the short term, it is virtually impossible to do for a lengthy time. Overall, diversification is essential for success in investment long term."}

{"983": "As someone who has experienced both sides of the student loan process - having had issues with my own loan and my parents running the financial aid department at a local university - let me offer some advice. My own student loan story involved graduating with debt and not being able to make payments due to early parenthood. I went through a deferment process, which varies by school and federal guidelines that change annually. Initially, any student can request repayment deferment, which is typically granted. Then there is the option for an extended deferment, which must be approved. In my case, my school denied my request, despite my providing significant documentation of my financial situation. They eventually caved and granted me the extended deferment.\n\nWhen it was time to start making payments, I opted to pay in six-month increments due to my school's complex payment system. However, due to a billing error, I ended up in collections and had to prove that I had made payments, despite their system showing otherwise. It took me five years to get out of collections due to this error, and I incurred significant fees.\n\nThe lesson here is that if you don't make payments, the lender will either put your loan into deferment or go after you. Most schools will opt for deferment, which usually lasts up to two years. After that, there is an optional deferment period. If you continue to not pay, you may be put into this bucket. However, if you don't communicate with the lender, you risk being swept into their credit collection process. By filling out the deferment paperwork, even if it is denied, you can buy yourself up to ten years.\n\nOnce you are in the collection process, anything can happen. If you can't get a home or car loan, it may not matter as much. But if you can, you may need to go to court or hire an attorney to deal with the fees and penalties that may arise. The moral of the story is that you will eventually have to pay off your student loans. Acting nice, filling out paperwork, and communicating with your school can buy you some time, but you will still have to pay and will incur interest on everything. If you don't have the money, defaulting may not be an entirely bad thing, but you need to try to work with your school to avoid penalties and have creditors calling your job.\n\nIn my case, a higher up at the school reviewed my case and called me to work out a plan. I had to provide significant documentation and deal with multiple agencies to clear up my credit, incurring significant time and effort. So the goal should be to make payments to avoid issues down the line."}

Diamond retailers often suggest spending three months' salary on an engagement ring, but despite having a moderate income, I spent nothing. My practical wife didn't care for jewelry and preferred a larger home. Thus, we allocated our money towards the downpayment. At that time, the house totaled 2.5 years of our salaries. Even a used car can equal a few months' worth of pay. However, if the individual is saving, has an emergency fund, and is making progress towards their long-term financial objectives, they could potentially afford a decent-sized TV with a week's salary. A week's to a month's salary could stretch to cover a good vacation. Your question presents a common concern for individuals starting in the workforce, though there are similar inquiries about spending more. Those usually come from students with a lower budget, but now have a higher income. To answer the question, they should list out their monthly expenses, assign a fair amount to savings, then determine how much is available for discretionary spending. It's worth noting that saving money is easier now with no mortgage or kids. During our early years of marriage, we lived off my wife's revenue and saved mine. Our budget tightened following the home purchase and the arrival of our child. Ultimately, the purchase of a PS4 depends more on the individual's overall finances than its $400 price tag."}

However, if you're thinking in the long term, you don't need to allocate a large portion of your portfolio to bonds. Additionally, it is wise to take advantage of tax breaks through accounts like IRAs and 401Ks.

Moreover, this trade would have disrupted the stock price unfavorably, indicating that a smaller trade was a better alternative. For example, a $100 stock purchase would not create significant disruptions, and could lead to a $10 profit (10% of $100), but the trade fee of $8 makes this approach unprofitable. Therefore, hoping for a 10% gain on every trade is unrealistic. \n\nYou correctly observed that swing trading on low-volume stocks is pointless. When you asked how people can earn significant money trading low-volume stocks, I suspect this is achieved by investors who believe in the company and its potential growth.

If you state that your company is worth $800K, then once the VC invests, it will be worth $1M, and they will own 20% of all shares; meanwhile, you will own the rest.

{"1018": "\n\nThe article by The Finance Buff, titled \"The Case Against the Roth 401k,\" examines why the Roth 401k is often at a disadvantage compared to a Traditional 401k. The author lists several reasons, including the fact that contributions to the 401k come from the top of your highest tax bracket rate, whereas withdrawals fill in from the bottom. For instance, if you are in the 28% tax bracket, each marginal dollar you contribute to the Traditional 401k reduces your tax burden by .28 cents. However, when you withdraw, the first $10,150 of income is tax-free (based on standard deductions and exemptions for 2014; $20,300 for married couples filing jointly). The subsequent dollars are taxed at the 10% tax bracket, and so on. This is an advantage for the Traditional 401k only if you earn less when withdrawing than you did when contributing, which is a reasonable assumption.\n\nAnother point made in the article is that if you live in a state with low or no state income tax, contributing to the Roth 401k can reduce the benefits of moving to a state with a lower income tax rate. Additionally, if your income increases and you start triggering credit phaseouts, contributing to the Traditional 401k can help you realize more of those credits.\n\nHowever, if none of these scenarios apply to you, contributing to the Roth 401k can be a valuable component of tax diversification."}

Both types of settlement are common, and businesses, entities, or traders use either one for various reasons. There is no governing body that mandates what type of settlement is available for a given futures contract. The lack of a mini or micro futures contract for extremely small amounts of currency futures that is physically settled is likely due to the fact that no one has created such a product yet. It could, however, exist but is unlikely as physically settled currency futures are usually utilized by entities operating in large sums. I apologize if there was any misunderstanding of the original question."}

{"1024": "\n\nAs mentioned in other responses, the primary reason for high exchange rates is to maximize profits. However, there is another smaller factor to consider: variations in currency values. When withdrawing cash from an ATM, you usually have a minute to review the current exchange rate. Within that time, the value of the currency may rise or fall, which presents an opportunity for exploitation. While significant shifts in major currencies are rare, they do occur. This is even more common in the case of minor currencies. For example, today, there was a notable increase of more than 2% in the exchange rate of Botswana Pula to Haitian Gourde. While this may not be the best illustration, it does show why a large margin is favorable. It's important to note that this argument only applies when the customer knows the exchange rate ahead of time. For cases where it's calculated after the transaction, there is no justification for such significant margins, except to offer other services at a lower cost."}

A high-quality program will enable you to keep track of multiple accounts effortlessly. A great program will separate different account balances from budget category balances. \n\nOnce you set up the software, enter all your various bank accounts with their balances. For instance, you may have several savings and checking accounts. The software will total up all the balances, and then it's time to allocate this money into different budget categories according to your spending plan. You can customize these categories as per your requirements, and your budget can be as detailed or broad as you like. \n\nWhen you receive your paycheck, you can also allocate the income into specific budget categories. At this point, it doesn't matter which accounts your money is in. The essential thing is that you have access to it. You can use a particular account for a specific budget category if you want, but it's not mandatory. For example, you will likely keep your grocery category money in a checking account, while your emergency fund remains in an interest-earning account.\n\nWith this approach, you may find that you don't require as many bank accounts as you did in the past because the software automatically separates your money into different accounts. There are various categories of personal finance software available, such as YNAB, Mvelopes, and EveryDollar, that utilize this approach of separating bank accounts from budget categories."}

{"1032": "\n\n:\n\nA simple definition or analogy for present value is the \"Principal\" or \"Loan Amount\" being lent and the future value is returning the Principal with the cost of borrowing. The FVIF or future value of a $1 is calculated as (1+i)^n, where \"i\" is the interest earned on present value. The PVIF or present value of a $1 is calculated as (1+i)^-n, where \"i\" is the interest paid on future value. These interest factors assume that interest is paid annually, but if interest is made more often within the payment year, the frequency of interest payment (m) will affect the interest earned or paid. The more frequent the interest payment, the more interest is earned or paid, and compounding occurs on each fraction of time. \n\nIf you need to make periodic loan repayments for a certain amount (say $1) for \"n\" periods, then the present value of all such periodic payments is the \"Principal\" or amount borrowed. This is the sum of discounted periodic payments. The present value of periodic payment of $1 can be calculated using the formula (1/1+i)^n, which simplifies to x. Then by replacing (1/1+i) with x, we get the geometric series form. The future value of periodic payments of $1 can be determined by multiplying the PVIFA by (1+i)^n. \n\nWhen calculating interest, if compounding occurs more frequently within the payment year, the annual effective yield (AEY) must be found to use for the PVIFA and FVIFA calculation for continuous compounding. \n\nAdjusting for inflation, if the amounts grow by g%, the present value of a $1 would be calculated by (1/(1+i+g))^n. \n\nIf loan payments increase or decrease by an amount \"Q\" per period, the present value of series of payments \"P\" that increase or decrease per period by an amount \"Q\" can be calculated using the given formulae. \n\nThe calculations discussed are available in the tadXL add-in for finance and as a JavaScript financial functions library tadJS. These libraries are property of the author writing this post except one for Excel, and are available for FREE for public use.

While you can gain some economies of scale with larger notes, I do not believe this should be the deciding factor in choosing note size. Instead, I base my note purchases on factors such as the borrower's credit history, loan stability, and interest rate. For example, I recently purchased a $100 note for a borrower with a reasonable loan amount, stable work history of more than 15 years, excellent credit score, and a great interest rate. I prefer 36-month notes and avoid purchasing notes that exceed a maximum of $100. If you are likely to sell the note prematurely, it is best to keep note size at $25, as the market is greater. I have had success with the trading account, where I purchase discounted notes from individuals who want out of LendingClub.

This approach costs only two points instead of 24. Note that if you only intend to visit one financial institution or have a particular lender in mind, the drop in credit score is only a few points. The above advice pertains only to those making loan inquiries at multiple institutions."}

{"1066": "\n\nBond ETFs are a type of bond mutual fund that allows for convenient trading of mutual fund shares in the same way that stocks are traded, with small share-size increments. This concept applies to both stock and bond funds. When purchasing these securities, it's important to consider the purchase fees and expense ratios. Different brokerages may charge varying amounts for security purchases, with some offering their own mutual funds at no trading fees but charging fees for ETFs. It's worth noting that some mutual funds have multiple classes, such as Vanguard's Investor, Admiral, and ETF classes, all with different minimum initial investments and expense ratios. While choosing between mutual funds and ETFs can be important, choosing a broker and fund type is often more crucial, with some brokers imposing high purchase or redemption fees for mutual funds and few offering free ETF trades. Additionally, index funds, which passively track certain indexes, typically have lower expense ratios than actively managed funds that aim to outperform the market but often underperform compared to index funds. See Vanguard's and Investopedia's explanations of mutual funds vs. ETFs for more information."}
{"1067": "\n\nRevised:\n\nWhen you give an order to a broker, you are essentially commanding them to sell a certain number of shares, say 100 shares of AAPL. If the broker successfully executes the entire order, it is called an executed order. If the order is only partially executed, it is referred to as a partially executed order. A transaction, on the other hand, is the actual exchange of shares for money. It is possible to have one or more transactions per executed order.\n\nFor instance, the broker may perform multiple transactions to carry out your request, possibly involving selling five sets of 20 shares each. If the broker is not able to execute your order, no transactions occur. \n\nThe fee schedule for transactions will be charged regardless of how many transactions are involved in filling the order or what the share prices are. For instance, a broker may only charge you $0.005 per share, subject to certain limits, regardless of what it takes to fill the order, as long as the limitations are not exceeded. Keep in mind that our Fixed pricing for stocks, ETFs (Exchange Traded Products, or ETPs), and warrants involves passing on some transaction fees to the client. Therefore, while fixed pricing may seem less variable, it still may not be the same for all trades. \n\nFor example, SEC fees vary and depend on factors such as share prices. When selling 100 shares of AAPL at $150 per share or 100 shares of AMZN at $940 per share, the broker will still charge a $0.50 fee for both orders. However, keep in mind that the SEC fee will differ based on the share prices. That means that the SEC fee is passed on to you, and it may vary depending on the price of the shares being traded. \n\nIt is important to note that the specific SEC fee mentioned in this context applies only to the seller and not the buyer. That is why the fee is called an aggregate sales fee rather than an aggregate trade value fee. The SEC fee is therefore only charged on sells rather than buys, which is highlighted to the reader."}

In fact, tax treaties often offer more favorable tax rates than those applicable to residents of the countries involved. For example, the tax rate between Italy and the US is lower than that for doing business in many parts of the United States. You can use this information to guide your Google search for relevant treaties, such as the one between Germany and Spain provided in this link (http://tmagazine.ey.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2011G_CM2300_Spain-Germany-sign-new-tax-treaty.pdf), which reveals a 5% dividend tax rate under that treaty as opposed to Spain's income tax rate of 18%. To minimize taxes, consider deferring taxes in the lower tax jurisdiction and paying a large one-time dividend when convenient. Avoid being taxed at the entity level by structuring your business in a way that ensures earnings are always distributed to non-resident owners as dividends. This way, you can avoid the 15% federal corporate tax in Germany and the 18% income tax in Spain, and instead pay just 5% tax on Spanish dividends. Do consult a tax attorney to help interpret the regulations and seek further information on the tax credit that Spain may offer if you pay taxes in Germany. There are several strategies available to lower your tax footprint in cases like this."}

{"1073": "\n\nIn today's world, credit unions have become small \"savings and loan\" banks, reminiscent of the banks that existed before bankers found ways to make money beyond writing loans. While credit unions may not always offer better interest rates or cheaper loans than traditional banks, they do tend to prioritize their depositors and borrowers, treating them as stockholders rather than just customers, making them a more pleasant option to deal with. There are some minor legal differences, for instance, in the type of insurance fund they use, and not everyone is eligible to open an account at any given credit union, depending on the community they serve. However, these differences rarely affect account holders. The main downside of credit unions is that they tend to have few branches, primarily in a limited geographic region. Nevertheless, I have been using a credit union located over 200 miles away from me, across two state lines, for decades now. Through bank-by-mail, bank-by-internet, ATM machines, and the \"branch exchange\" program offered by participating credit unions, I haven't needed to visit the branch in person. On one occasion, however, when I purchased a house for $200,000, I had to go to several different branch-exchange credit unions due to a daily network limit of $50K/CU. This was an unusual situation where I struggled to get the numbers out of the real estate agents until just a few days before the sale. Today, these limitations may have relaxed, but if faced with a similar situation, I would consider taking a scenic drive to visit an actual branch of my own credit union.

Most regulations are local, but some may be federal. Incorporation can be beneficial, but it is not always necessary. Businesses such as landscapers, housekeepers, and babysitters can operate as individuals.\n\nOne must pay taxes by properly recording income and expenses and filing tax returns annually. It is recommended to employ a tax professional to file taxes, as it can be a complicated process. It is important to keep records of all expenses directly and indirectly related to the business. Where indirect business expenses are concerned, a good accountant can help. A business owner should ensure that all their income is recorded and address common costs such as electricity and internet connection which can be counted as legitimate business expenses.\n\nLicenses may be necessary depending on the business activity, and business liability insurance may be a consideration. As far as when the business is considered such, it's arguable, but when a product creation and making an effort to conduct business activity should be taken seriously.\n\nIncorporation can be deferred if one is an individual, and it is not necessary for most small businesses. Incorporating can protect you from a lot of issues, but it is not necessary on day one, so it can be put off until later. If you do incorporate or are an S-corp, you can avoid paying double taxes.\n\nOverall, starting a small business requires effort, including lots of research and planning, but it is an achievable goal."}
{"1079": "\n\nThe previous commenters were correct to reference the prisoner's dilemma, but I would like to provide a more detailed explanation due to my interest in game theory. The prisoner's dilemma is a classic scenario in game theory where it is in the best interest of two or more players to cooperate, but they fail to do so. Wikipedia provides a simple example using prisoners, but I will use Fidel and Charles, who are fund managers at Fidelity and Charles Schwab respectively. In order to shorten the table, I used abbreviations - INC means increase fees, KEEP means keeping fees the same, and DEC means decreasing fees. Here is the dilemma itself, as shown in the table, which displays the resulting market shares if each fund manager follows the course of action suggested. This example is not mathematically rigorous since I fabricated the numbers, but it serves as a good example. The most profitable course of action would be for both fund managers to agree to increase their fees, which would keep their market shares the same but increase their profits as they earn more fees. However, there are several reasons why this would not happen. In a simple example like this, economies of scale exist in the investment fund market. As funds grow larger, their costs decrease. Thus, if a fund manager decreases their fees (betraying the other players), this decrease will not be enough to reduce their profits. In fact, the increased market share resulting from such a decrease may well dominate the decreased fees and lead to higher profits. The prisoner's dilemma is highly applicable to markets like these, which are oligopolies with a small number of established sellers possessing considerable market power. If you wanted to model the market for donor-advised funds using game theory, several additional factors would need to be considered. Naturally, there are more than two firms in the market. It is likely that the market is an oligopoly with significant economies of scale, although I have not extensively researched this. The market for donor-advised funds is complicated by the fact that these are philanthropic funds. This may introduce tax implications or the problem of goodwill and institutional opinion of these funds. Although both funds increasing their fees may increase their profits in theory, institutional investors may look upon this as pure profit-seeking and shift their funds elsewhere. They may choose to invest in smaller funds with higher fees but better reputations. Reputation is important for any company, but it is paramount when the fund/investment vehicle is philanthropic. Although I am not an expert in game theory, there may be other nuances to the situation that I am unaware of."}

{"1081": "\n\nShould I report this property as a rental or a second home on my 2015 taxes? If you did not rent it out or list it for rent, then it can be considered a second home. However, if it was listed for rent, no matter if tenants were found, by advertising or hiring a property manager, then it cannot be categorized as a second home. The treatment depends on the specifics of the situation. I have heard that if I treat this property as a rental, then I can claim renovation costs on my taxes as a capital expenditure through depreciation over 27.5 years. This is accurate. However, if I view this property as a personal second home, then renovation costs are not tax-deductible. This is incorrect. As a matter of fact, both instances receive the same treatment. Renovation costs are included in determining the basis. In the case of renting, the home can be depreciated, and any renovations are included in that. In personal use cases, depreciation is not permitted, but renovation costs are still added to the basis, and therefore are not viewed as personal expenses. What about mortgage interest? Is it deducted from gross income or only rental income? If it is a personal use property, you can deduct mortgage interest up to a point on your Schedule A, contingent on other itemized deductions. For a rental, mortgage interest is deducted from rental income on Schedule E. There is no limit to the deduction, but some may be deferred if it exceeds income, provided that the rental is at fair market value. In conclusion, if treating it as a rental, report it as a rental, and if not, do not."}

For instance, a $2 monthly fee equates to $24 per year, a $2,000 average balance at 0.05% earns $29 per year, $250 monthly in rewards debit card usage translates to $24 per year, and $2 per month in ATM fees adds up to $24 annually. Before Chase Manhattan's acquisition in 2008, Washington Mutual offered \"free\" checking accounts with no monthly or annual charges and no fees for using their ATMs. However, overdraft fees were not free, and if customers averaged three per year at $34 each, the bank could reach its markup target for the accounts."}

These companies typically operate independently from the rest of the bank and have strict procedures in place to ensure that client information is not shared with other parts of the bank. These companies also have the same fiduciary duties as independent asset managers and may use the services of other banks for brokers and dealers. Reputation management is crucial for banks, and conflicts of interest are typically handled correctly. Furthermore, independence is not always a constant. Neuberger Berman is an excellent example of a company that was once independent but lost its independence when it merged with Lehman Brothers in 2003. However, when Lehman went bankrupt in 2008, NB did not join its parent company in bankruptcy, and its clients' assets were not lost. The company continued to operate until it was acquired by management. Finally, the difference between these companies is mostly a matter of marketing and positioning."}

{"1086": "\n\nIt is essential to set both long-term goals and milestones to achieve those goals. As mentioned in my previous article about saving 15% of one's income, I presented a table that illustrates savings starting at age 20 and ending at 60, resulting in 18-1/2 year's worth of income saved due to investment returns. If we follow the 4% rule, the 18-1/2 year's savings would replace 74% of one's income at retirement. Keep in mind that this number can be adjusted depending on factors such as Social Security replacing 30% and a decrease in spending during retirement. Therefore, it may be possible to save less than what the table shows. The most critical aspect of this table is that it serves as a starting point, indicating that by age 30, one should aim to have at least 2X their income saved. However, it may be more rational to have 1X income saved instead.\n\nCurrently, you have saved slightly over half of 1X income, and you plan on spending almost half of your savings on a single purchase. Achieving financial independence involves creating a sustainable income without relying on employment. The best way to do this is by having a high saving rate. Although your income seems stable now, it is possible that it is relatively new, which may explain why you do not have over $200K saved in the bank.

While you can purchase and exchange data on these servers, the company owns everything within their system and has the right to terminate your access at any time, rendering your virtual accounts worthless. For this reason, most countries have refrained from taxing in-game inventory as it is challenging to define. However, exchanges for local currency are generally taxed as a typical sale. Depending on your region, there may be tax codes for digital goods sales.

{"1106": "\n\nThe meaning of the term is not clear as it can be interpreted in two ways: its broad semantic and metaphorical meaning, and its mechanical interpretation. Although net buying/selling has a clear meaning in the former sense, it is not as straightforward in the latter sense where it is unclear which variables in the market represent this quantity. The only way prices move is through matching a buyer and a seller, resulting in an instantaneous balance across the bid/ask spread. However, in reality, there are standing orders at various prices, and a measure of the volume at different price levels in each of the bid/ask books could be used to determine the net buying/selling. Nevertheless, actual transactions only occur when matched across the spread, so the addition of a large order volume on one side or the other that is far away from the bid/offer is irrelevant to the notion of net buying/selling. The closest thing to actual market mechanics is the comparative total volumes during the period that would have still been executed if forced to execute at the end of the period price. Assuming that traders' valuations are fixed through the period in question and trading occurs on the basis of fundamentals, we have two cases. If the price falls, we can assume that all buyers who executed above the last price in the period would have happily bought at the last price while all sellers who executed below the last price in the period would also be happy to sell for more. The former will be larger than the latter. If the price rises, the reverse is true."}

However, in the prospectus, the company stated that the rights \"will not be quoted ex\" on NYSE, which means there was no separate listing of these rights on NYSE.

The value of these contributions should be determined with the assistance of an accountant, as it depends on the lesser of the adjusted basis versus the fair market value. The depreciated amounts are considered business expenses, and the depreciation adjusts the company's basis for calculating capital gains/losses when sold. If multiple partners are involved or if your accountant prefers, the Open Balance Equity can be debited, and the owner's contribution can be credited to a capital account in their name representing their basis when sold. From an accounting perspective, if the Open Balance Equity account comes to zero, directly crediting the capital accounts could be done, but it is recommended to use Open Balance Equity for identifying initial equity percentages and identifying contributors who may need to contribute more to the partnership."}

The benefits of that work align with your business rather than you personally.

On the other hand, using a TV from stock as a demo model would be part of your trade and not withdrawn as a good for personal use. \n\nRegarding services provided to your dad, it depends on whether you are offering them as part of your business or on a personal level. If you give your dad a free TV, it is evident that you have paid yourself with another TV and then gifted it to him. However, with services, it is unclear whether you are receiving them for free or providing them yourself.

The benefit is that half of your losses will be covered while the cost is that half of your profits will be lost. In order for this to be a net gain for you, you must expect to gain more than you will lose. However, if you expect that the investment has negative value, it's unclear why you would choose to invest. Additionally, this offer does not align the incentives of both parties. As the person investing, you are incurring an opportunity cost while the person making the investment decision is not. Therefore, they have an incentive to be conservative with their choices. For example, if you could make 1% in a low-risk CD, the person investing might prefer to put you in something that is expected to yield only 0.5% (since they get to keep half the profits at no cost to themselves). However, you would likely prefer to just put your money in the CD, allowing you to keep the full 1% profit, rather than just half of a 0.5% profit."}

It's worth noting that Yahoo's cash flow statement lines do not sum to the provided totals.\n\nWhen calculating working capital, be sure to subtract current liabilities from current assets, not total liabilities from total assets. Furthermore, changes in working capital should reflect the difference in net current assets from the previous quarter.

In order to make a profit, you must sell your shares at a price that is higher than $20.

If the individual seeking a loan is currently not living with their parents and does not have bad credit, then she may apply for a loan without her parents cosigning. However, if she is not living with them and they are not covering her living expenses, they cannot claim her as a dependent. If the person wishes to stand up to their parents, they may politely explain how loans work and state that they will apply on their own if their parents refuse to cosign. This can only be done if they do not reside with their parents. The parents will be required to stop claiming the individual as a dependent if they do not cosign. If the parents refuse, the individual can choose to apply on their own and may warn the parents that they will be held accountable if they continue claiming her as a dependent. The parents may ultimately agree to cosign in order to not lose her as a dependent, which would significantly impact their tax situation. If they do not, the individual may withhold being claimed as a dependent from the parents, which would increase their taxes.

However, unqualified covered calls can suspend the holding period of your stock, resulting in a short-term gain or loss. To simplify matters, consider selling out-of-the-money calls or trading in an IRA account. Criteria for a qualified covered call (QCC) include having more than 30 days to expiration and a strike price greater than or equal to the first available in-the-money strike price below the previous day's closing price. If the previous day's closing price is $25 or less, the strike price of the call being sold must be greater than 85% of yesterday's closing price. For a previous day's closing price between $60.01 and $150, days to expiration of 60-90, and a strike price greater than 85% but less than 10 points in the money, you may write a covered call two strikes in the money. Lastly, if the previous day's closing price is greater than $150 and days till expiration is greater than 90, a covered call two strikes in the money may be written.

{"1134": "You may not fully understand how credit scoring works. Let's begin with the purpose of a credit score which is to assess your level of default risk. When a lender reviews your credit score, they want to understand the proportion of your credit already in use, as this is a significant factor in determining your solvency. If you are utilizing 100% of your credit, it suggests that you may not have the capacity to pay your bills, making you insolvent. Conversely, having a utilization rate of 0% demonstrates that you are financially stable. The majority of credit card users fall somewhere in between these two levels. When it comes to large loans like mortgages and car loans, banks consider your credit score and application-related data like your income and employment history to evaluate your eligibility for a loan. Credit cards are classified as \"revolving\" accounts because they are meant to be used to purchase goods and services, with the expectation that you will pay your balance off in full every month. Based on this information, my recommendation to you would be to take some time to better understand how credit scoring works."}

{"1138": "\n\nOne option you have is to purchase options. However, your time horizon is a crucial factor to consider due to theta burn. Options are available in weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, and even longer time horizons, known as leaps. Once you have determined your desired time frame, you must also consider the implied volatility of the underlying asset. As an example, if the current price of SPY is hypothetically $100, and you purchase a weekly call option with a strike price of $100.50 priced at $0.55 cents, the underlying asset needs to increase by $0.50 in one day to become profitable. However, at time zero, the option is only worth its intrinsic value, which would be 5 cents if the SPY increased from $100 to $100.55. If you paid 55 cents for the option, and it is worth only 5 cents at expiration, you have lost nearly 91% of your investment. Buying and holding the underlying asset would likely result in a smaller loss since the leverage typically follows a 10x scale. This is why timing is so essential in trading options. You can also calculate how much a stock, like MSFT, contributes to the movement of the SPX in terms of points. You can use this information to make synthetic trades on SPY options or trade MSFT stock on margin, but it is crucial to proceed with caution.

Unless you happen to be a footballer with a sizeable savings pot that you want to set aside for a rainy day when you can no longer play at your peak, there's no need to focus solely on pensions. This doesn't mean you shouldn't invest, nor save, though. There are several factors to consider.\n\nFirstly, as a young person, you likely have a higher tolerance for risk. Even if a pension fund with a high-risk, high-return strategy isn't quite right for you, there are plenty of other investments to consider. For example, you could invest in further education, health improvements, skills development, building social connections, gaining valuable experiences, property or starting a family or business.\n\nSecondly, as a young professional, you're unlikely to have reached your full earning potential yet. Due to the law of diminishing marginal utility, \u00a3100 per month now has a higher impact on your lifestyle than \u00a3700 will have in 7-10 years time once your earnings plateau. It's easier to save \u00a3700 a month from \u00a33,000 than to save \u00a3100 from \u00a31,300 monthly income.\n\nLastly, let's face it - forty years is a long investment horizon, and many things will change over time. One drawback of UK pensions is that you have limited control of your money until you reach a certain age. Instead, consider saving up a cushion consisting of cash or near-cash assets to cover your expenses for at least two months and up to a year. The exact size depends on your personal needs and situation.\n\nOn a strategic level, it's worthwhile investing any surplus cash into building the foundations of a happy life for the next 40 years. This could include investing in further education or training for yourself or your partner. Consider starting a family, which may help you reach your earning potential faster. Finally, invest in finding something you love and become good at it - cash can help you get there faster.

{"1146": "\n\nSimply put, it's best to invest your money into the option with the higher interest rate, be it savings or debt repayment. For instance, if you were to deposit $1000 into each account at the beginning of month A, your savings would amount to $1001.6 at the end of the month ($1000 + 1000 x 2% annual interest / 12). Conversely, if you had a loan to repay, your balance at the end of month A would be $1005.7. (Your initial balance of $17000 plus 6.8% interest for one month would result in a balance of $17096.3; $16000 of which would bring the balance to $16090.6. The difference is $1005.7, which means repaying your loan yields a return about 3.5 times greater than saving your money.)"}

{"1150": "\n\nHow does home ownership fit into a financial portfolio? While some may consider it a hedge against rent or dollar inflation, others view it as a liability with no place alongside other real investments. A home is costly to live in, maintain, and does not offer a return unless sold for more than the total paid. With an outstanding mortgage, owning a home costs money, even without considering property taxes and utilities. The only way to turn a home into an investment is by renting it out for more than the total cost of ownership, but this means that it cannot be lived in.\n\nWhen looking at payments on a home mortgage, it is important to view them as similar to low-risk, low-reward investments. Paying off a mortgage offers the same benefits as putting money into a certificate of deposit with a similar term and return. Additionally, paying off a mortgage improves cash flow over time and helps reduce financial risk. It is important to remember that interest rates may change, and over time, cash flow may improve. If financial circumstances change, it is possible to call the bank to stop extra payments or renegotiate the loan terms. Ideally, all debt should be paid off by the time of retirement, so that fixed expenses can be easily reduced if necessary.\n\nIt is crucial to have some savings in easily accessible and low-risk investments, such as savings accounts or government bonds, before making aggressive payments on loans. This ensures that unexpected expenses, especially those related to homeownership, can be met without incurring more debt. While paying off a mortgage is a valuable form of savings, it is not liquid, unlike stocks, bonds, and other mutual funds. Overall, owning a home requires careful financial planning, with an emphasis on reducing debt and building savings."}

DHA arbitrarily lowers rents by 10 to 22% and insists on multiple valuations without proper justification. They disregard market evidence and use bullying tactics to coerce lessors into accepting below-market rents, threatening them with expensive third-party reviews, with costs shared between the lessors and taxpayers. DHA's influence on the third-party review process is biased, destroying valuation independence.

When considering investments, it is essential to consider two factors: the amount of time you intend to keep your money invested and your willingness to accept price volatility. Your answers will help determine the appropriate investment asset class(es) for your situation.

Or, they may terminate you on your notice day and offer a severance payment that equals two weeks of pay, as it seems they did in your case. However, your employer should have explained this to you when you left on February 23rd.\n\nAssuming that you work in an at-will state, your employer's actions are legal, but they may not be morally right.

They also adjust their hedge position whenever the delta changes due to underlying price changes, which incurs a cost to the bank, making them short volatility or short VEGA. Buying options can be seen as paying someone to execute a specific trading strategy. Those who sell options are happy to buy them back at a discount, but unrolling the hedging position costs the bank.

{"1164": "\n\nIn a previous comment, I inquired about the frequency of grocery purchases. As a means of simplification, I will assume weekly purchases are made. If a roommate is present during the week following a grocery purchase, they are responsible for paying their share based on their outlined preferences. To determine the amount owed, you must track grocery costs by category for that week and calculate each person's balance accordingly. If there is a partial week with fewer people who will be in attendance due to holiday or other circumstances, the groceries purchased will reflect this, and the cost of shares will decrease accordingly. Preferences only need to be indicated once, and attendance will be taken on a weekly basis. \n\nThe only issue remaining is how to record shares. One approach is to predict consumption in advance; for example, if a person typically consumes 3 shares of milk and .5 shares of butter, these amounts can be added up for the week, and the bill can be divided accordingly. However, this method requires predicting consumption, which may not always be accurate. An alternative approach is to calculate based on actual consumption. This involves a deposit paid by all to create the initial grocery supply, to be refunded when a person leaves the co-op. Shares would be calculated by who participated in the week prior to the grocery purchase. This method allows for mid-week refreshes if any item incurs higher than expected consumption, with the mid-week bill paid and added to the end-of-week refresh trip."}

{"1166": "\n\nThere are various reasons for this, as previously discussed by other answers. However, I would like to highlight and elaborate on one particular reason: the avoidance of double taxation, specifically on corporate earnings. \n\nTypically, a corporation's earnings are subject to taxes at about 40% (including State income taxes) in the US. When dividends are distributed, they are taxed again at the individual level, and the same applies when equity is sold and the distribution is treated as a capital gain. This is why tax rates for dividends and capital gains are the same in the US. \n\nFor example, let's consider a C Corporation with only one owner. The company earns $1,000,000 before income taxes and pays $400,000 in taxes, leaving retained earnings of $600,000. To access this money, the owner can either distribute a dividend or sell their stake to someone else. In either case, the $600,000 will be taxed again at around 20%-30% at the individual level, depending on your state. This translates to an effective tax rate of over 50%. \n\nMany people invest in stocks, including mutual funds, where dividends and capital gains are taxed at lower rates. Consequently, tax returns without wage income often have very low average tax rates. However, these investments are still subject to their own taxes or are subject to taxes accruing in the form of future tax liability."}

If she's particularly savvy with her finances, she might even be able to buy a home with the remaining funds. During this time, your friend could search for a financial advisor who can provide personalized and relevant advice to the girl.\n\nIn my own experience with my stepdaughter, learning about financial responsibility together helped to build a strong financial relationship. We both took a course called Financial Peace University, which cost around $100 and was offered through local churches.

Utilities are generally obligated to accept price regulation in exchange for a monopoly on utility business in a specific geographic area. While utilities may not guarantee profits, they are typically considered stable investments that appreciate over time. However, due to deregulation, investing in utilities has become more complicated. Utilities must build and maintain physical infrastructure, buy fuel, and generate electricity. As a result, they face fixed costs, regulated pricing, market-driven fuel costs, and market-driven demand for electricity. The significant costs associated with expanding the electric grid means that uneven demand growth or economic disruptions in the utility's service area can negatively impact the firm's return on equity and stock price. The location of the utility also plays a role in stock performance, as demonstrated by the contrasting stock performance of HE (the Hawaiian electric utility) to ED (Consolidated Edison, the NYC utility) to SO (Southern Companies, the utility for much of the South). In order to invest successfully in utilities, it is essential to have a buying strategy. During market downturns, money flows into utilities, which are considered low-risk \"defensive\" investments, and inflates the price. Investors should avoid buying utilities at their peak and instead, dollar-cost average a position over several years and hold onto it.

Additionally, changing jobs before paying back the 401k loan may result in taxes and penalties if not paid within 90 days. It's important to note that student loan debt may have options for deferment or adjustable payments, while 401k loans do not. Furthermore, while interest paid on student loans can be deducted, interest paid to a 401k loan cannot, even though it's paid to yourself. Additionally, using a 401k loan may limit long-term growth potential since it's typically at a lower interest rate than potential earnings within the 401k. It may also limit flexibility since other loans or withdrawals may be needed in the future, and amortization schedules for 401k loans may require higher payments over a shorter period. While credit card debt may be negotiated or discharged during hard times, a 401k loan cannot, and it might prove detrimental to long-term financial security.

{"1181": "\n\nRevised: To determine the probability of hitting a target price, some mathematics and an assumption about the expected return of your stock are required. First, let's break down the components of this equation. IV represents the implied volatility of the option, which is the volatility of the underlying associated with the observed option price. As a practical measure, volatility is the annualized standard deviation of returns. Therefore, if the monthly standard deviation is Y, then Y*SQRT(12) represents the volatility. To de-annualize the volatility and obtain the expected standard deviation of the return between now and expiration, multiply IV by SQRT(DaysToExpire/356). When multiplied by the stock price, the resulting value represents X, which is the standard deviation of the dollars gained or lost between now and expiration. Denote the price change as A so that the standard deviation of A is X. \n\nTo find the expression for the probability of hitting a target level, Q, it is mathematically represented as 1 - Pr( A < Q - StockPrice). Note that the cumulative distribution function always finds the probability of being below a threshold, so we subtract the probability of being below the threshold from 1 to find the probability of exceeding Q. \n\nUsing Excel and assuming a mean of zero for returns, the probability of hitting or exceeding Q at expiration is represented as [formula not shown here].

Additionally, not all securities have circuit breakers in place, and the exact triggers for these circuit breakers are not public information. In rare cases, exchanges may reverse trades, but this is typically reserved for institutional traders who make mistakes.

For instance, if this year's output increased by 3%, they aim for a 4-5% growth rate in the money supply. This approach helps to avoid high inflation or deflation. Low-interest rates on Treasury bills (T-bills) prompt banks to borrow more money, which is created out of thin air and added to the economy. Conversely, high-interest rates discourage borrowing, leading to a reduced growth rate or possibly contraction in the money supply. Therefore, the Federal Reserve adjusts the interest rates depending on the acceleration or deceleration of economic growth rates and inflation rates that are considered too high or too low."}

The basis value of property inherited from a decedent is typically either the fair market value (FMV) of the property on the date of the decedent's death or the FMV of the property on an alternate valuation date chosen by the estate executor, as outlined in the Instructions for Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return. If the person who died received the property from you or your spouse within a year of their death, Publication 551, Basis of Assets, provides further guidance.

Exchanges publish their order and trade feeds onto a packet network that subscribers' machines listen and respond to. The point in time when a trade occurs within an exchange's matching engine is labeled as \"T0.\" The specifics of that trade are then published by the exchange, and the moment when that information is first available to subscribers is \"T1.\" The time difference between T1 and T0 can range from a few microseconds to 100 milliseconds in some notorious cases. Subscribers typically don't run machines on each exchange's network because it's expensive and requires a team of engineers to understand each exchange's protocols.\n\nIt's unlikely that Google pays for direct access to exchanges. Instead, Google probably pays another company who is a subscriber to each exchange around the world (such as Reuters) to forward incoming information to them. Reuters charges customers based on how fast they want the forwarded information. After Reuters parses the info they get at T1, checks it for errors, and translates it into a format customers can understand, they then put their new packets on the internet at time T2. The slow crawl across the internet begins, and your website of choice gets its pre-processed data at time T3.\n\nYour favorite website has to unpack the data, store it in some sort of database, and push it onto their website at time T4. A sophisticated website might then force a refresh of your browser at time T4 to show you the new information. However, this involves yet another slow crawl across the internet to your home computer, competing with your neighbor's 24/7 Netflix stream, and so on. Your browser then refreshes (with its 83 plugins and banner ads everywhere), and you finally see the update at T5.\n\nAssuming Google is doing the most expensive and labor-intensive thing possible, the networks between you, Google, and the exchange are as short as possible, and a thousand other factors are in play, you won't hear about a trade for anywhere from 500 milliseconds to 5 seconds after T0. In a more realistic scenario, that time will be 10-30 seconds. Despite this, Google calls it Realtime on their disclaimer page because they feel they're getting the information to you as fast as possible for free.\n\nComputers subscribed to an exchange heard about the trade way back at time T1 and acted on that information in a few microseconds. That's almost definitely before T2 and definitely before T3. The market for a particular instrument could change direction five times before Google even shows the first trade. Therefore, if someone wants true real-time access, they must subscribe to the exchange feed, or sign up with a broker that provides its own optimized market feeds (note that this is not an endorsement of trading through brokers)."}

{"1202": "\n\nIt is simple for an honest vendor to provide a refund, which may only cost a few pennies. However, initiating a chargeback incurs a substantial irreversible fee of around $20 as an administrative charge for the merchant. They will also need to refund the charge if it is reversed. This can be particularly detrimental to an honest vendor who would have happily refunded the payment, and it is unfair. If the merchant is now out-of-pocket from the administrative fee, their best option is to fight the chargeback, for which they have already paid a fee. A chargeback could also negatively affect the merchant's standing, resulting in higher fees, or being banned from accepting Visa/MC payments if their chargeback rate is higher than the average in their industry. \n\nFor small merchants with low transaction volumes, a single chargeback could adversely impact their chargeback rate. The level of evidence for a chargeback varies based on fraud patterns and the merchant's ability to recover. Items like gift cards, casino chips, and concert tickets are less likely to qualify for a chargeback, as they can easily be converted to cash value. It is also essential to remember that a credit card chargeback only cancels a payment method, not the outstanding balance.

{"1223": "Congratulations on acknowledging your problem and making the commitment to become debt-free. It's commendable that you've taken the first step in recognizing your mistakes, and getting rid of debt is a worthwhile objective. Regarding debt consolidation, there are only two practical reasons to consider it. The first is to lower your monthly payments, but this can draw out the timeframe before you become debt-free and cost you more in interest. I advise against this unless your cash flow is being stretched too much. Based on your situation, debt consolidation doesn't seem necessary for this reason. The second reason is to lower interest rates, which can help shorten the time it takes to pay off debt, but the consolidation loan's interest rate that you're considering is already high at 13.89%. Even if some of your outstanding debt has higher interest rates, you might not save significantly by consolidating with this loan. Only consider other options for a consolidation loan if you can obtain a better rate. I understand from your inquiry that you're looking at this loan to close credit card accounts quickly. While I agree you need to stop using them, cutting up or destroying credit cards will also work, and you won't require a consolidation loan for this. Your statement that you're contemplating adding $3,000 to your debt is concerning, especially when your aim is to become debt-free. The cash buffer from the loan is also not advisable. My recommendation is to begin your journey to financial freedom by cutting up or destroying your credit cards today. Debit cards, checks, and cash are the options to use moving forward. Start following a monthly budget to allocate all of your earnings. Having a clear notion of where your money goes can help you determine what to spend on and prevent overspending. Budgeting software can simplify this. Your first priority should be to create a small emergency fund of up to $1,500, which acts as your safety net for unexpected costs. Use it only in emergencies, replenish it once depleted, and aim to create it within a month. Afterward, aggressively and rapidly address your debt, paying off whichever loans you wish in any order. At the rate you suggested, you might be debt-free within eighteen months. Once paid off, close any credit card accounts you have. Don't listen to mainstream advice recommending keeping some unused credit card accounts to bolster your credit score; just shut them down. After becoming debt-free, start creating a 3-to-6 month emergency fund, supported by the money you were spending on your debt. This nest egg will provide you with a significant level of financial resilience that will help you during financial emergencies. For more advice on becoming debt-free and budgeting, consider reading The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey."}

This discrepancy can be more pronounced for comparisons between developed and developing economies, where smaller-scale financial systems may lead to less stock market participation.\n\nComparing the US with Brazil, for instance, reveals that while US GDP is around 10 times Brazil's, US total market cap is roughly 36 times that of Brazil's. Switzerland, on the other hand, has a total market cap nearly double that of Brazil, despite its total GDP being less than half of Brazil's. As the all-world index encompasses all investable economies, it may include some economies with disproportionately lower market cap shares than their GDP shares. Also, this index tracks only large- and mid-cap stocks, further skewing weightings to developed economies like the US, with its enlarged share of the biggest companies. It is critical to examine weightings in greater detail to determine whether those factors precisely account for the level of discrepancy observed in this specific index. Nonetheless, this explanation should provide some insight into why the US may have a greater weight in a stock index than in raw GDP."}
{"1226": "\n\n\nIf you're struggling to make ends meet, it's important to evaluate your financial situation before making any big purchases, like a car or a home. You should only consider buying such assets if you can clearly show (even to yourself) that doing so would lower your monthly expenses. While there are exceptions, such as when buying a car can actually reduce expenses, you need to think carefully about whether you truly need the item or just feel pressured to get it. Remember, wealthy people invest in income streams, while poorer people buy expenses. \n\nTo start, track your spending for a month or two, including non-regular bills like subscriptions, insurance, and utilities. Use this information to create a budget, focusing on the facts rather than making judgments about your spending. Once you have a clear idea of your current expenses, identify areas where you can cut back, starting with the easiest changes. Create a revised budget based on these numbers and stick to it. Follow up by tracking your actual spending and making adjustments as needed. \n\nWhen you find areas of your budget where you have flexibility, resist the urge to spend that money on discretionary items. Instead, pay yourself first by putting the money directly into a savings account. Even if you start with a simple savings account that offers little interest, the habit of saving is critical. If possible, set up a direct deposit into your savings account, and force yourself to live within your remaining budget. Aim to save a decent percentage of your income, but start by saving something \u2013 anything \u2013 and putting it in a liquid account that offers easy access to your funds. This will allow you to build up your savings and create more financial options for yourself in the future."}
{"1227": "\n\nIt appears from your edits that you may not yet possess the necessary knowledge required to delve into investing with a heavy hand. This is because you seem to be unfamiliar with fundamental finance and investment concepts. The returns you refer to as \"yearly\" are merely the earnings reported by public companies every 12 months - they do not reflect the earnings of individual investors, which consist of dividends paid by the company (usually annually, semi-annually or quarterly) and the sale of previously purchased shares. In a three-month timeframe, investments in interest-earning investments, such as bank deposits, will generate around 0.5%, while investments in the stock market could yield roughly 2% (but carry higher risks than interest-earning investments). Attempting to generate substantial earnings in just three months is an unrealistic prospect that entails extreme levels of risk (similar to gambling in a casino). It takes years to make safe investments. In the short term, the best approach to earning more money is to earn more through a better paying job or taking on a part-time job, or to reduce expenses (prepare a budget, pay off high-interest debt, and spend less than you earn). I strongly recommend you go through this website to learn more about budgeting and how to manage your finances better.

However, if the shares were traded publicly, it would not be a Private Equity company.\n\nIt is worth noting that the term \"Equity\" refers specifically to the ownership of the company. Therefore, not all private investment companies are Private Equity companies. If a private investment company only buys bonds rather than owning the company itself, it would not be considered a Private Equity company.\n\nHedge Fund is a term that is commonly used to describe a type of investment fund that attempts to hedge risks in its portfolio. This involves carefully considering the types of investments it makes to minimize risk. In many cases, the term \"Hedge Fund\" is interchangeable with other terms like \"investment fund.\" \n\nOver time, the trend has shifted towards using more general terms like \"investment fund\" instead of \"hedge fund,\" as can be seen in trends data from Google. It is worth noting that \"Hedge Fund\" has often been associated with high finance and Wall Street types who may exploit various situations for their own gain. However, without a clear definition, the term does not hold much meaning.\n\nWhen comparing \"Hedge Fund\" and \"Private Equity,\" the two terms correlate closely. While \"Private Equity\" is sometimes misused to refer to investment bankers, it has a clear definition unrelated to this characterization. In general, a Private Equity firm is a company that invests in and owns other companies, often with the aim of restructuring or improving their operations."}

{"1234": "\n\nA simple explanation for the average investor: When an investor buys stock, they hope to sell it for a profit later on. This is known as \"going long.\" If the investor wants to sell their stock to avoid further losses, they can place a stop order. Stop orders are only used when selling, not buying. \n\nA stop-loss sell order (or stop sell) can be used to automatically sell the stock if its price drops below a certain point. For instance, if you set a stop sell at $40 and the stock falls to $35, your broker will sell your shares at the lowest possible price. \n\nA stop-loss limit sell order (or stop limit sell) works in a similar way, but with the added protection that the stock won't be sold for less than a specified limit price. For example, a stop limit sell at $40 with a limit of $39 means that if the stock falls to $40, the investor will only sell if the stock can be sold at $39 or higher. This way, the investor avoids selling at a price lower than they are comfortable with. \n\nIt's important to note that there is still some risk involved, as the stock price could fall very rapidly and the limit sell order may not be executed before the stock hits a lower price point. In this scenario, the investor would still own the stock, which could now be worth less than the limit sell price."}

{"1236": "\n\nYou're correct that putting down 20% impacts your interest rate, but not always significantly. You'll need to do your own research to confirm. However, putting down 20% has a critical impact on your equity rather than your monthly payment. If the DC housing market takes a downturn, you could fall underwater on your mortgage, and a smaller down payment would only compound the issue. On the other hand, putting down 20% or more makes you an attractive borrower and reduces the risk of a short sale in the future. Personally, I wouldn't buy a home without putting down at least 20%, and I've budgeted to achieve that over time. As for finding a lender, I found books from the library helpful to understand the process. I also got recommendations from my realtor (who was a family friend I trusted) and others who had recently purchased homes. I compared four lenders and negotiated the best terms based on their estimate sheets, which include fees like origination fees and discount points. You should be clear on which fees the lender controls and which they don't. Before closing, you'll also want to find a good title company, settlement company (which may be the same as the title company or your lender), and a survey company if required for your title insurance. Also, don't forget homeowner's insurance coverage. Closing costs can run over $10,000 on a $500,000 home, so it's critical to do your research and understand them. Finally, take time to educate yourself on homebuying, neighborhoods, and prices. Rushing into a purchase can cost you a lot of money in the long run."}

Your bank or investment broker, as well as your employer, require it to report your earnings, and you need it to file tax forms. In general, no one else should be asking you for it. While the gym's request for your social security number was unnecessary, it is unlikely to have any adverse consequences. On the other hand, the store cards are a more significant issue. Depending on how they used your information, you could potentially harm the credit history of the person who legitimately owns that number, and if this occurs, you may be guilty of fraud should they or the store come after you. With that in mind, it's best not to pursue this matter. Furthermore, if you're posting online, utilize a disposable user ID and avoid using your real name. Alternatively, contacting the appropriate authorities and admitting your mistake may be an option, but consulting with a lawyer would be wise before doing so."}

The first is your actual balance, which reflects deposits and withdrawals that have cleared. Both the bank and the other involved party have exchanged proof of authorization, debited the payor's account, transferred money between banks, and credited the payee's account. The second balance is the available balance, which includes any amount the bank is \"floating\" while a deposit clears, and deducts any potentially unauthorized transactions. \n\nFor instance, let's say you intended to pay $X to the train company. Your bank received notice of this transaction and put an \"authorization hold\" on $X, which reduced your available balance but not your actual balance. If the bank later declines to process the transaction for any reason, such as insufficient funds or suspicion of fraud, the hold remains in place as a precaution. Usually, holds for debit purchases expire between one and five days after being placed, unless the merchant provides definite proof of amount and authorization before then. However, the expiration time may vary depending on bank policy, and holds for certain accounts or types of payment can last up to thirty days. \n\nIf you need to remove a hold or have any inquiries, you must contact the bank, not the merchant. In certain circumstances, the bank can remove a hold upon request."}

Secondly, it's important to assess whether the bank offers the level of service you require. This could be in the form of easily accessible branch locations, ATMs, or efficient online services that allow you to move your money rapidly and accurately. Once these factors are met, you can weigh the extras in order to make a final decision. These might include free trades, discounted rates on mortgages, or free checking, depending on your personal situation.\n\nIf you are currently receiving the extra benefits that you value whilst also enjoying the safety and level of service provided, there is no need to switch. However, in my case, I would not see free trades as a significant benefit, and any decline in safety or service would prompt me to move to another institution. It's vital to remember that seemingly free services ultimately come with a cost \u2013 financial institutions avail themselves of the opportunity to make money by lending deposited funds or even charging for other services utilized by customers.\n\nIn my instance, over the last nine months, I earned a paltry $3.33 YTD in savings at my bank, affiliated likely with these so-called \"free\" trades.

If you cannot trust your assistant with important information, whether personal or business-related, it's time to find a different assistant. The purpose of an assistant is to make your life easier, not to create more work for you by having to double-check their work. You need to decide whether you are comfortable taking a leap of faith and trusting your assistant or finding someone else to work with. Thus, an assistant who needs their work edited is less useful.\n\nWhile location may not be a factor in terms of trustworthiness, the legal framework around your relationship with your assistant can vary based on your location. If both you and your virtual assistant are located in the US, your recourse when something goes wrong is likely more straightforward than if they are located overseas. You should consider the cost versus the potential risk when deciding whether to work with an overseas assistant or find someone domestically. Consider using a licensed and bonded CPA or other professional if you do not feel comfortable taking risks.\n\nAnother option is to hire a local, part-time assistant if you can live without someone being bonded. You may be surprised at how affordable this can be, especially if you can find a college student majoring in finance, accounting, or law.

{"1253": "\n\nThe following revision provides a clearer and more concise explanation of standard deviation, Sharpe Ratio, R-squared, Alpha, and Beta:\n\nStandard deviation, represented by the Greek letter sigma (\u03c3), reveals how much variation exists from the average in statistics and probability theory. A low standard deviation implies that data points are close to the mean or expected value, while a high standard deviation suggests that data points are widely spread out.\n\nFor stocks, a lower standard deviation indicates less volatility, while a higher standard deviation denotes more volatility, which means how much change a stock's price undergoes over time. Mean or average return indicates what the figures would be if all returns were identical. There are several ways to compute the mean, including taking the sum and division by the number of elements, compound annual growth rate, and cubic root.\n\nThe Sharpe Ratio, created by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe, measures the risk-adjusted performance by subtracting the risk-free rate, such as the 10-year U.S Treasury bond, from the portfolio's rate of return and dividing the result by its standard deviation.\n\nLinear regression modelling involves R-squared, Alpha, and Beta. R-squared measures how well the portfolio fits a standard, like the S&P 500 index in the case of U.S. stocks, on a scale of 0 to 1. A higher R-squared indicates better conformance with the index.\n\nAlpha and Beta relate to the classic slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, where y is the portfolio's return, and x is the index's return. Beta represents the return's multiple and Alpha reflects the additional return without this multiple. For example, an S&P 500 index fund has Beta near 1 and Alpha near 0, while other funds try to achieve high Alpha or high Beta. The modern portfolio theory emphasizes investment diversification to lessen R-squared and move beta and alpha towards the ideal level."}

Once this foundation is established, there are several key questions to ask yourself before making any investment decisions. Once you have answered these questions, a simple first suggestion can be made: \n\nIf you are confident in handling your investments independently and prefer a low-maintenance approach with an uncertain horizon, consider researching online banks that offer ETFs such as IWDA (accumulation, where dividends are reinvested or income, where dividends are paid out) and other specific options. Plan to buy and hold your investments for at least five years. \n\nIf you are confident in your ability to manage your investments and prefer a high-maintenance approach with a long horizon, you may consider stock picking. However, it is important to note that beating the market requires significant research (10+ hours per week) and may not be advisable with a small initial investment sum. In any case, always carefully review the prospectus of any investment, especially if a bank recommends certain actively traded funds. Yearly management fees of 2-3% are not uncommon and can significantly eat into your returns.\n\nConsider investing in ETFs such as IWDA, which only have a yearly cost of 0.20%. This is much less than the annual management fees of actively traded funds, and IWDA has consistently performed well over time. Regardless of your initial investment amount, focus on increasing your portfolio over time while keeping expenses in check. Compounding interest will then work in your favor."}

But how does a bank benefit from this, and why would they help someone lower their mortgage payments? Banks profit by selling new loans. For instance, big banks usually sell mortgage loans to institutional investors and only service them. By creating a new loan, banks generate another product to sell. They have already made profits by selling the previous loan and therefore do not mind about it. Investors might not make the same interest they could have generated if the loan had been held for the entire term, but they spread the investments evenly to avoid significant impacts from each refinancing. Credit unions don't always sell their mortgages, and their interest is to assist their shareholders in reducing their payments. Furthermore, banks that do not sell mortgages continue making profits, as the money paid off from the loan enables them to service another borrower."}
{"1267": "\n\nUnfortunately, there is no straightforward answer to this question as it is a very personal decision. Everyone's situation is unique, and despite the fact that there are many knowledgeable people here, they may not make the same decision as you even if they were in your exact situation. Personal finance is just that, personal. In my own situation, I would not borrow money during my retirement. If I had the necessary funds, I would use them to help fund the purchase, and if I didn't, I simply wouldn't help. For me, preserving wealth (in your case) is much more about behavior than math, despite being a math person. Borrowing money during retirement poses a significant amount of risk during a vulnerable period of your life where it may be harder to recover from negative events. This could cause financial issues later down the road. However, others may disagree with me and provide supporting evidence for borrowing instead of withdrawing money from investments based on the potential income from your nest egg. Keep in mind that if you pull out money from your investments, you may have to pay taxes on the withdrawn amount, which can greatly affect your income. In the US, the withdrawn amount would be taxed at the highest marginal rate, meaning that you might have to pull out more money than necessary to cover the taxes and down payment. The third option would be to find alternative ways to help your child, such as providing monthly payments for mortgage payments or contributing to home improvements to reduce the price of the house. It is also possible that your child may not be ready to buy a home just yet. Ultimately, it all depends on your individual situation. For instance, if you have a significant amount of investments, a comfortable pension with disposable income, and your child is only asking for a small amount, then withdrawing funds may not be a significant risk for you. In this situation, you can safely pull out money and not be concerned about recovering it, as your nest egg will quickly do so."}

When a stock trades at different values on different days, it signifies that someone was either willing to pay a higher price or someone was willing to sell at a lower price. While exchanges or regulators may intervene by halting trading, canceling trades, or imposing limits on significant price movements, this is not relevant to the point being made. It is important to note that a stock can trade at $10 and then $100 in the very next trade or even $1 in the next trade. Asking about the changes between the close of one day and the opening of the next is akin to inquiring about the difference between one trade and the next.

Additionally, investing in retirement accounts can also provide tax advantages. It is important to take into account the appropriate limits and predict how they may change over time.\n\nFurthermore, the money not being spent on your mortgage is available for emergencies or other expenditure. While investing is a good option, having more free access to your funds could hold extra value for you. Also, consider whether overpayments are an option for your mortgage.

CFDs are derivatives, meaning you profit from the difference in price or \"delta\" rather than the absolute value of the underlying asset. Essentially, two parties place opposing bets and are obligated to pay or receive payment based on the outcome. There is a winner and a loser.

However, in regards to your second question, \"Are REITs a good option to generate passive income for a while?\" there seemed to be a lack of clear response. The time frame of \"a while\" is crucial in answering this question. If your goal is to invest for a relatively short period (let's say, seven years or less), investing in a REIT may prove to be especially beneficial. One significant advantage is that transaction fees are substantially lower when compared to purchasing real estate, which often involves inspection and titling fees, taxes, and broker fees, resulting in a round-trip transaction cost of around 10%. In contrast, stock/ETF trades are practically or potentially free today. A secondary advantage of owning a REIT is its liquidity. If you intend to sell your investment at a specific point in time, you can effortlessly log into your brokerage account and execute your transaction, unlike liquidating an investment property that would require time on the market, potentially involve removing tenants, fixing up the property, and other procedures.

However, the advantage of owning individual stocks is that you can avoid management or holding fees, unlike ETFs or mutual funds. Provided that you assess the fundamentals of the company you plan to buy, such as its P/B, P/E, PEG, among others, and avoid excessive trading, individual stocks can generate decent returns. As a best practice, I suggest re-balancing your asset classes semi-annually and conducting an individual stock check-up.

Typically, the standard fee for a credit card transaction is 30 cents plus 2.5% of the amount, although the actual figures may differ slightly. Consequently, small businesses often find it unprofitable to process small charges and thus set a minimum purchase limit for credit/debit card payments. However, large retailers like Wal-Mart, Target, Safeway, or Home Depot can negotiate volume discounts, enabling them to incur significantly lower transaction costs than 30 cents plus 2.5%. Although the rewards points you earn from your credit/debit card do not depend on where you use them, I advocate for being mindful of the type of merchant. For enormous corporations, feel free to swipe your card, regardless of the purchase amount. For small businesses, try to pay with cash; otherwise, use your card if the cost exceeds several hundred dollars, as they may provide a cash discount.

For example, a $1 dividend per share when the stock value is $10 yields a 10% dividend yield, whereas a $2 dividend per share when the stock value is $40 yields a 5% dividend yield.

Alternatively, if you have a significant other whose income could sustain payments, this would also be beneficial. Failing to do so could result in significant financial loss if you cannot make the payments and/or if the housing market drastically declines.

{"1298": "\n\nInvestopedia provides insight into how a stock split affects options. Normally, option contracts control 100 shares of an underlying security at a predetermined strike price. To calculate the new coverage of an option, multiply the split ratio by the old coverage of 100 shares. To compute the new strike price, divide the old strike price by the split ratio. For instance, if you own a call for 100 shares of XYZ with a strike price of $75 and XYZ's stock splits 2 for 1, the option becomes 200 shares with a strike price of $37.50. Similarly, if the split is 3 for 2, the option becomes 150 shares with a strike price of $50. Therefore, a 2 for 1 stock split halves the option strike prices. It is important to note that after a split, each option contract still controls 100 shares.\n\nRegarding how dividends impact option prices, a well-written article explains that dividend payments could lead to decreased stock prices due to the reduction of a company's assets. If a stock is anticipated to decrease, its call options lose extrinsic value while its put options gain extrinsic value before this happens. Dividends decrease the extrinsic value of call options, not simply because of the expected drop in the stock price, but also because call options buyers do not receive dividends. Therefore, call options of dividend-paying stocks are less desirable than the stocks themselves, reducing their extrinsic value. The amount of the call option price drop because of dividends varies based on the option's moneyness. In the case of in-the-money call options with high delta, the drop would be most significant on the ex-date, while out-of-the-money call options with lower delta would be least affected.\n\nOn the other side, if a stock is expected to drop by some amount, such as after a dividend, the extrinsic value of its put options would already have factored this into the pricing. This effect relies on the moneyness of options. In-the-money put options would increase in extrinsic value almost as much as the dividend rate itself since they would have a delta of nearly -1, which means it would gain around a dollar if the stock dropped by a dollar. Therefore, moneyness is key as in-the-money put options would rise in extrinsic value more than out-of-the-money put options. It is essential to note that a $1 dividend payment does not always decrease an option's price by $1 on the ex-dividend date. Depending on whether an option is a call or put, in-the-money or out-of-the-money, the effect may differ."}

However, in the case of forex, the physical good is a currency. A spot currency product trades in the denomination on the right-hand side (RHS) of the product name. For instance, exchanging EUR/USD implies paying USD currency to acquire EUR \"units,\" while selling EUR/USD involves receiving USD by giving away EUR \"units.\" In this case, EUR is the \"physical good.\" To simplify this concept, all products, not just currencies, can be considered trading pairs. To illustrate, AAPL in my mind is AAPL/USD. When buying AAPL/USD, you pay USD to obtain AAPL units. Conversely, selling AAPL/USD implies receiving USD by giving away AAPL units. The thing on the left represents the physical good (even if it's money) that you are trading, while the thing on the right is the money you're exchanging. Thus, when buying a lot of AAPL, 100 shares are purchased at their current price in dollars. Similarly, purchasing a lot of EUR/USD indicates buying 100K Euros at their current price in dollars."}

{"1303": "\n\nEssentially, I agree with what @littleadv has said, but I'd like to emphasize what I believe is the most critical point. As previously mentioned, you hire a title company for their expertise. If there was a legal flaw in the county office's recorded title, would you be able to identify it? Your question is similar to asking why you should see a doctor when you can cultivate herbal medicines in your garden and self-treat. There's a possibility that you could manage it, but doctors and pharmacists have years of training to do it correctly, while you probably don't. Even if it's feasible to learn everything necessary to complete it correctly, would you want to devote your time to studying something you might only do once every ten years? Will you be able to remember everything, or will you have to learn it all over again? \n\nThe most important point, however, is that title companies provide insurance in case the title is flawed. This is why I would use a title company even if no bank were involved, and I was paying cash. If there's a legal flaw in the title and someone else has ownership of my home, and I lose the dispute, I could lose up to $100,000, and possibly even more. This is a significant risk. Paying a few hundred dollars for insurance against such a risk is well worth it. \n\nFurthermore, conducting \"due diligence\" is not an easy task. It's not solely about verifying that a title is on file at the courthouse and has the correct seal on it. It's about ensuring that no one else has a legal claim to the property. For instance, perhaps someone forged a signature on a deed three owners ago, making the sale fraudulent. The individual who was deceived or their heirs could subsequently claim ownership of the property. Alternatively, the previous homeowner could have failed to pay a contractor who performed repairs on the house, resulting in a lien on the property. It's unlikely that you would be able to identify a forged document, and you almost surely would have no means of determining if the signature on an otherwise valid-looking document is forged. You'd also have to do extensive research to identify every contractor who has ever worked on the house and ensure that none of them have a claim."}

{"1305": "\n\nWhen you said \"it's expensive,\" I assumed you meant that the monthly payments are too high. To address this, you'll need to pay off your old loan by selling your current car, which is the challenging part. To determine the possible selling price of your car, use Kelley Blue Book as a reference, but keep in mind that the actual figure might be lower. Check similar cars' prices in your local classifieds, as you'll most likely receive less money if you trade your car in instead of selling it privately. If you owe more than your car's worth, you're in a difficult position. Suppose you don't receive enough money to clear the loan after selling the car. In that case, you'll remain responsible for the remainder of the loan. It might be best to stick with the car you currently own and exercise caution regarding payment schedules and loan terms when financing your next vehicle. Most car loans don't impose early payment penalties, but it's a good idea to double-check your loan agreement to be certain."}

If you need a mortgage loan, most banks prefer not to lend more than 80% of the appraised value of the house. The appraised value is determined once the bank's appraiser assesses the property after the seller has accepted your bid. If your bid is larger than the appraised value, you can still proceed with the deal as long as you have personal funds to pay the balance.\n\nIt is best to make an offer in the same ballpark as the market value to reduce the risk of the deal falling through. Additionally, it is smart to obtain pre-approval from a lender, so you have an idea of how much you can afford and what properties to consider.

{"1308": "\n\nCFDs (Contracts for Difference) are contracts between you and your broker based on the difference in price of the underlying asset when you open and close a position. Contrary to buying the actual asset, you are not actually acquiring any underlying assets when you trade CFDs. Shares CFDs, particularly, are akin to purchasing shares on margin. Holding long positions overnight would require you to pay interest; on the other hand, holding short positions overnight would earn you interest. Typically, traders use CFDs for short-term trading. However, depending on your trading plan, they can also be used for medium to longer-term trading. It is important to bear in mind that you stand to lose more than your initial contract amount since you are buying on margin. To mitigate this risk, position sizing and stop-loss orders can be used. For instance, if you want to invest $10,000 in a particular share trading at $10 per share, you can purchase 1000 shares or 1000 CFDs in that share. Your initial expense with the CFDs might only be $1000 (at a margin rate of 10%). This way, you limit your risk to the same as if you were buying the shares directly, instead of exposing yourself to an initial outlay of $10,000 with CFDs."}

For instance, individuals with low income would spend a more significant portion of their income on food compared to those with high income. Therefore, any budgeting guideline should be considered as a starting point, and individuals must create their budget plan by examining their income and expenses. Begin by listing all the necessity expenses, including fixed ones, and allocate funds accordingly. The remaining funds can be spent on discretionary expenses such as hobbies, entertainment, and other items. Finding ways to save on necessities can help to free up funds for discretionary spending. Each person's budget will differ based on their income and priorities. Novices might benefit from using budgeting software such as YNAB, EveryDollar, or Mvelopes to simplify the process."}
{"1311": "\n\nI suggest opening a Roth IRA that can help you generate a substantial amount in the long run without paying taxes on your earnings. However, contributions are subject to yearly limits, which is currently at $5,500. You can still contribute for the previous and current tax year, as long as you haven't filed your taxes yet. It is recommended to have two accounts at a discount brokerage firm; one for the Roth IRA, and the other for the excess funds that cannot be put in the Roth IRA. Note that you cannot transfer stocks from the brokerage account to the Roth IRA; only cash is permitted. To transfer, first sell some of the stocks and turn them into cash. Keep in mind that any gains or losses incurred will need to be reported to the IRS. It is advisable to invest in stocks for the long term, and consider signing up for a premium service like \"Motley Fool Stock Advisor\" to get monthly stock picks. Invest small amounts in each stock and avoid loading up on a single stock. This will ensure that you own quality companies that can withstand market fluctuations. Good luck with your investment journey!"}
{"1312": "\n\nThe process of creating and redeeming shares in an ETF is known as the Creation/Redemption mechanism. This mechanism can result in differences between the value of the holdings and the trading price of the ETF. When an ETF is thinly traded, this difference can be significant since the mechanism typically requires lots of 50,000 shares. \n\nAuthorized Participants (APs) are responsible for buying and selling ETF shares. As demand for additional shares of an ETF increases, APs will create new shares by purchasing underlying securities and exchanging them for new shares. Conversely, when demand for shares decreases, APs will process redemptions by exchanging shares for underlying securities.\n\nFor example, if the NAV of an ETF is $20/share and the trading price is $30/share, APs can buy underlying securities for $20/share and exchange them for 50,000 new shares of the ETF. They can then sell those ETF shares for $30/share, resulting in a profit. The process is reversed if the prices are switched. The SEC also acknowledges this process."}

If you don't utilize your credit card to its full potential, the Bank may ask you to lower your credit limit but this is not equivalent to missing a payment. However, making only the minimum payment is not recommended, and you should aim to clear the balance within three months. This is comparable to a short-term line of credit. Failing to pay off the balance or transferring it to another card suggests a cash flow problem or \"kite flying,\" which some banks refer to as previous behavior with cheque accounts. By consistently using the credit and paying it off, you are likely to receive offers for a credit increase, which the Bureau will be informed of.

This is especially true for online purchases across state lines. For instance, in Massachusetts, where sales tax is applicable, if you buy something from a seller located in New Hampshire, where sales tax is not levied, you are required to pay sales tax on the purchase while filing your income tax returns. Opting for a service that doesn't include taxes merely shifts the burden of paperwork to the buyer. Though you might save some money by paying in cash, as discussed by others, it comes with a risk if something goes wrong with the transaction. The seller may take your money and not fulfill their end of the agreement, or do a shoddy job, or worse, cause damage to your property.

Typically, this amounts to around 30% of the total mortgage payments made, which can be personally calculated by dividing the expected sale price of the property by the total mortgage payments. Therefore, it's generally advisable to only walk away from your mortgage if the cost of rent in your desired location is significantly lower (around 30%) than your mortgage payment and is stable. Rather than immediately abandoning your mortgage, consider refinancing your mortgage with a new one. In 2008, interest rates were approximately 5.8%, whereas current rates are at approximately 3.6%.

Regardless, individuals or entities engaging in such trades must file certain forms. Form 3 is mandatory when a person first becomes an insider by assuming the role of an officer, director, or acquiring a specified percentage of shares. Form 4 must be filed when an existing insider trades the company's stock. Alternatively, reports of small value insider trades are filed using Form 5, but with a delay. Further details are available on the SEC website. Additionally, it is possible that a large number of options or derivatives were activated by either an officer, director or lending institution. In the case of officers or directors, they must report such cases in the SEC's Form 4.

{"1352": "\n\nLoans are governed by three key factors that determine the level of risk to lenders and therefore, the interest rate. An interest rate on a loan is linked to market interest rates and the level of risk associated with the borrower. The three features of a loan that reduce the risk of default are as follows:\n\n1. Amortisation: This involves using a portion of the monthly payments to pay down the principal amount borrowed. Since the principal amount decreases over time, the risk of default decreases as well.\n\n2. Security: A secured loan uses an asset such as a car, house, boat, gold, or shares as collateral. If the borrower defaults, the lender can repossess the asset to recover their money.\n\n3. Guarantor: This involves having a third party guarantee the repayment of the loan. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the guarantor is legally responsible for settling the debt.\n\nThese three features reduce the risk of default, and therefore, the interest rate is lower on loans that possess these characteristics. The interest rate on a loan is made up of three components: the market interest rate (m), the interest rate premium based on the borrower's creditworthiness (c), and the value of loan features that help reduce the risk (l). Therefore, the formula for calculating the interest rate is: r = m + c - l.\n\nCredit ratings are not always an exact science, and two lenders may assess the same credit score differently. This is due to various business reasons and loan book criteria, which will not be discussed here. It is important to note that different loan types offer varying levels of flexibility at different interest rates. For instance, a person who does not want to risk losing their car would not opt for a secured loan, but instead opt for a loan with a guarantor."}
{"1353": "\n\nYou may earn a profit in nominal dollars (or units of your currency), but whether you make a profit in real dollars depends on inflation and the ability to sell your tokens to someone else for a higher price. For instance, if you bought a token for 50 U in the past, and now you can either spend 52 U for a token or use your existing token to buy a liter of milk, you might think you earned a profit of 2 U. However, the real or illusionary nature of your profit depends on what else you can do with the token.\n\nSuppose a token and a hamburger each cost 50 U in the past, but now a hamburger costs 52 U. If you can sell your token for 52 U and still buy a hamburger for 50 U, you gain 2 U or make a profit. However, if a hamburger now costs 52 U or more, then selling your token for 52 U merely enables you to maintain your original purchasing power in hamburgers. This demonstrates that, in practice, the idea of \"profit\" depends on the overall economy and the relative price changes of various goods.\n\nMoreover, in reality, currency is not tied to a particular commodity like the milk token, so its value may decrease in the absolute sense. Suppose you sold a book for $5, which may not enable you to purchase the same book in the future if prices have risen. If inflation escalates, it can lead to the token's loss of value or decrease in purchasing power.\n\nTherefore, while it's simple to calculate profits in currency units, it's hard to measure real terms. This concept is interconnected with the capacity to trade currency for goods and services, as the inflation-adjusted dollar gauge will vary depending on the goods being purchased. Inflation figures released by governments use a basket of commodities to estimate the overall price changes in the economy."}

For instance, if a company is facing a significant lawsuit, it is not allowed to distribute surplus cash as dividends. If such a lawsuit is successful, the company will not have any money to pay out. The Company Law Board ensures that all these provisions are followed in a just and equitable manner. Thus, when we say \"these covenants include provisions about passing dividends,\" it means the company has to exercise due diligence when deciding on the dividends to be paid out."}

{"1357": "\n\nAssuming that you need a car to get to work, let's discuss replacing the one you've lost. The biggest challenge with buying a car is often the idea of the monthly payment. Dealers often play with numbers to create a payment that seems manageable, but this does not necessarily provide you with the best deal. An 18-month lease term is not typical; 24 or 36-month terms are more common. While paying off your student loans is a wise goal, it is essential to consider the cost of your choices. Personal finance requires delaying immediate gratification for long-term benefits, and paying off loans will provide you with more financial flexibility in the future. Spending $5400 for a car you'll only drive for 18 months is not wise. It's no better than buying an unreliable used car that's plagued you with problems in the past. It's crucial to find a car you can afford upfront, which you'll still be able to use once the loan is paid off. I recommend looking for a vehicle with around 30k miles and paying it off as soon as possible. Then, you can drive it for another 70-120k miles before trading it for a newer model, which you can purchase with cash, freeing you from the monthly payment trap. You might even enjoy future negotiations with dealerships as you'll be immune to their manipulations and search for the best possible cash price."}

{"1359": "\n\nDepending on your loan provider and their method of calculating interest rates (daily, monthly, bi-monthly, etc.), your interest may be figured either daily or monthly (although monthly is a common assumption). Assuming a daily calculation, it would make sense to make bi-weekly payments. For instance, at 4% annual interest on a $150,000 home loan, the interest added each day is roughly $16.44 due to compounding interest. The interest amount owed grows quickly, particularly if you skip a monthly payment. \n\nPaying off a loan sooner results in paying less interest, but not everyone knows about compounding interest. One may check the Compound Interest Formula for more information. However, this formula does not take into account regular payments. \n\nMaking bi-weekly payments or a full payment before interest calculation, particularly if it is calculated monthly, will help pay down the principal amount faster and, as a result, reduce the overall interest owed. This advice is also relevant to credit card payments."}

To increase your chances of finding a better rate, consider checking with local credit unions, particularly those affiliated with your employer.

For example, Natwest offers a fixed rate bond that yields 3.2% over the next year, which may be worth considering for a deposit of that size. Alternatively, you could consider allocating 90k into a fixed rate bond and keeping the remaining 10k in an instant access account. Although you can earn up to 7k tax-free in the UK, it's worth bearing in mind that most bank accounts deduct tax at source. You'll need to claim this back from the government yourself.

However, using such tactics requires caution since it may not always be clear how it will impact financial aid. Financial aid encompasses both grants and loans, and strategies that work for one school may not work for others. Furthermore, elite schools with larger endowments have generous aid policies that enable families with high incomes to pay minimal or no tuition fees. Thus, you may want to research the financial aid policies of institutions that interest your daughter. It can be useful to speak to financial aid advisors at colleges, high school counselors, and financial advisors to understand the nuances of which assets to adjust.

This money should be saved in a passbook savings account. \n\nSecondly, establish an emergency fund for unexpected events such as a hospital visit or a broken appliance.

If you change jobs, rollover your savings into a self-directed IRA, and invest in an ETF that offers dividends.

{"1368": "\n\nHere is a revised version of the text:\n\nIn addition to the previously mentioned strategies, here is a more comprehensive approach that incorporates your idea. To begin, options prices should include future dividend payments. Therefore, assuming all other variables remain constant, a put option that is at the money presently will be in the money after the dividend, and thus more expensive than a put option that is currently out of the money but at the money after the dividend has been paid. If unprotected futures are priced accurately, they should reflect dividend payments based on past history and, upon maturity after the payment, earn a lower profit upon delivery of the physical stock. Protected futures, on the other hand, should reflect the expected total return value of the stock at the time of maturity, where dividends are calculated into the price. During the dividend payout process, any payments will be debited from your cash and credited to the counterparty. This strategy significantly reduces risk, with the sole risk being a lower-than-anticipated dividend payout. However, this level of security comes at a higher cost. To determine if your anticipated dividend yield exceeds the lending rate after all hedging instrument costs are subtracted, evaluate the calculated difference. If it is favorable, proceed with the trade."}

{"1370": "\n\nI concur with your assessment that, purely from an \"expected future value\" perspective, paying the loan off as swiftly as possible, and foregoing next year's loan, is advantageous. Due to the recently increased interest rates of new student loans, the balance has shifted, and prolonging payment is no longer the automatic preferred route. However, it is important to consider the fact that, unlike many people, you will have to repay the loan eventually. Therefore, when assessing the net cost over your lifetime, it is best to pay it off quickly. Nevertheless, I urge you to take into account a few counterpoints before settling on a decision. Firstly, refraining from paying the loan off provides you with a good safety net. If anything impairs your career, like an economic downturn or health issues or a career break, you will not be compelled to repay the loan. Thus, the money you would have saved in paying off the loan will be utilized elsewhere, which might be more beneficial. Secondly, not paying off the loan earlier allows for increased net cash during your younger years, when you are most likely to have immediate cash needs, such as a home purchase deposit. More cash availability could offer more options like this, making it feasible to purchase a house earlier, or even lead to higher deposits that could potentially reduce the interest rate on your entire mortgage balance. Such savings could possibly outweigh the 6% interest rate on the student loan, even though it appears to be comparatively higher."}
{"1371": "\n\nRevised: If the check is made out to BigCo, it becomes unclear how Jack can compensate himself for the equity sale as it appears as though BigCo owns the equity instead of Jack. Therefore, Jack does not receive compensation for the equity sale as the company trades shares for money, which is used for expansion. In the long term, the capital gain from expansion may exceed the value of a $200,000 no-interest loan given to the company. \n\nFor instance, suppose the value of the company before investing $250,000 is $1 million. In that case, the value after investing would be $1.25 million, which means $250,000 is 20% of the company's value. If BigCo gives the buyer 25% of its stake, the buyer would obtain a $312,500 stake for only $250,000. Therefore, BigCo should only give the buyer the correct percentage, which is 20% in this instance.\n\nAlternatively, Jack could sell 25% of his personal shares for $250,000, which would not change the assessed value of the company but only Jack's stake. He could then loan the company $200,000, which would also not affect the assessed value of the company. Though the company gains $200,000, it also has an offsetting debt of $200,000, which results in no net change, and the assets and liabilities balance the same.\n\nThus, if one knows the assessed value of the company as $1 million and that the buyer is paying $250,000 for a 25% stake at the same assessment, then one can infer that the check is written to Jack. If the check is made out to BigCo, then one or more of those numbers is incorrect, such as the buyer getting a 20% stake or paying $333,333.33, or the value of the company before the investment is $750,000. There could also be a combination of smaller changes that balance out."}

It is not recommended to use a mortgage solely to establish credit, as the 4% interest will outweigh the benefits. However, if you have the option to buy a house outright or get a mortgage, getting a mortgage may be the better choice due to the added leverage that can help increase investments.

The aim is for the lower tranche to absorb any losses caused by defaulting mortgages. I intend to keep these bonds for myself. Therefore, the buyers of the higher tranche are protected unless the defaults exceed $20,000,000, which in turn prompts the rating agencies to assign the top tranche an AAA rating, and investors are quick to buy. Essentially, the top bond issue is overcollateralized, meaning the entire value of $120,000,000 is used to back it up.

These plans are typically funded through separate payroll deductions and are known as \"defined benefit\" (DB) plans, which promise either a set lump sum or a yearly income upon retirement. DB plans are not limited to government programs, as some private companies also offer them, though they are becoming less common for funding reasons. In contrast, \"defined contribution\" (DC) plans are where employees and/or employers contribute to retirement accounts, with resulting lump sums or yearly payments based on the performance of investments. The contribution amount is fixed, but the resulting benefit is not promised. In short, DB plans promise benefits at retirement, while DC plans only promise contributions during employment."}

We were given a hypothetical scenario: you're getting kicked out of your parents' house at the age of 18 with only $1000 cash, your high school diploma, and a farewell from your parents. The challenge was to find a place to live, secure a job, and have a mode of transportation within three months. The budget had to include all essential expenses such as rent, utilities, food, toiletries, and clothing. We were encouraged to account for additional expenses such as gasoline and laundromats, and not forget about handling taxes. The end result of our project was a report of our first month of independent living, a budget for the subsequent three months, and a continuing budget for a typical month thereafter. \n\nAlthough it may seem like an intense project for a twelve-year-old, it provided us with a valuable life lesson. Some of us had to take trips to the grocery store and compare prices, visit different stores to explore various options, or get creative with our appliances and belongings. A few over-zealous classmates made the mistake of buying brand new things or buying unnecessary items, while others who thought they could make a living off babysitting quickly realized it wasn't feasible.

However, if a domain name is purchased for investment or resale, the costs must be capitalized and cannot be amortized because a domain name has no useful life. Although your decision to capitalize is correct, your amortization deductions may be challenged by the IRS. When you sell your domain, how you treat it will impact the gain or loss. If you treat it as a 197 intangible and had ordinary deductions through amortization, your gain will be ordinary. If you treat it as a capital asset, your gain will be a capital gain.

When purchasing a stock, the buyer becomes a shareholder and owns a small percentage of the company, which may entitle them to a share of the profits and a say in the company's decisions. Stocks may be classified as either \"common\" or \"preferred,\" with \"common\" stock typically granting voting rights and the possibility of dividends, and \"preferred\" stock offering higher dividend rates and some payment guarantees but no voting rights. The sale of equity is not usually an option for non-profit organizations or governmental entities, as they lack profits to distribute.\n\nOn the other hand, bonds are representations of the company's debt load and function similarly to a corporate credit card. A company issues bonds in order to generate cash for various purposes, and investors buy bonds at less-than-face value, with the expectation of receiving the full face value at the bond's term end. The difference between the purchase price and the term-end face value is the interest charge, expressed as a yield or annual percentage yield (APY), and is determined by the bond's remaining term and purchaser's investment. Highly-rated bonds may have yields of 4-6%, but bonds yielding 17% or more are generally regarded as risky and denote \"junk status.\""}

Flowing from legislation and regulation, significant cash transactions are regarded with suspicion, as they can be utilized for activities such as financing terrorism, tax evasion, and the buying or selling of illicit goods (e.g., drugs or stolen merchandise). Additionally, cash can be used to engage in general illegal transactions, including bribery. Consequently, all banks in Europe are obligated to report their suspicions around such activities to relevant authorities, with Finanspolisen (the Financial Police) serving as the Swedish entity responsible for such oversight. Reporting requirements are not limited to cash transactions. Rather, any suspicious transaction, regardless of how it is executed, must be reported. To achieve this level of oversight, banks operating in Sweden must know their customers well; they must be aware of how money flows in and out of any given account, sometimes utilizing specialized software to detect suspicious patterns. This process does not require obtaining permission from the FBI to withdraw cash. Customers are, however, required to supply descriptions regarding their planned cash usage. These descriptions are retained and may be sent to the Financial Police. The goal of these regulations is not to hinder legitimate transactions, rather to detect and prosecute illegal activities."}

Despite the value of gold estimated at a few trillion dollars, this pales in comparison to the wealth of the United States alone, let alone the world. Additionally, half of the world's population cannot even afford two ounces of gold. As a result, there is pressure to reopen mines that had costs pushing $800/ounce. It is essential to understand that the supply of $300 gold is long gone.

As the money is invested in stock markets, it is often recommended to leave it there for a longer duration to maximize returns. Therefore, it is possible to keep the money invested without withdrawing it and paying additional premiums. This way, the initial investment can grow, and you can consider withdrawing it at a later time when it is most financially advantageous for you."}

These investors tend to conduct their trading activities towards the end of the day, primarily to ensure their end-of-day balances reflect their targets accurately and are easy to audit. While timing the market is not their top priority, the substantial amount of trading activity during this period of the day for stocks that are popular among institutions such as AAPL, which constitutes a significant portion of an index many funds track, is noticeable. The introduction of an underlying paper (PDF) explains multiple reasons why there is a lot of trading activity towards the end of the day. Nonetheless, fraud activities have been rampant during this period for an extended period.

{"1447": "\n\nRewritten:\n\nIn the next sentence, what is meant by \"buyer's commission?\" It is actually referring to the commission that the buyer pays to their broker for executing the trade. For example, if a buyer wants to purchase 100 shares at $20 per share, and the broker charges a 4% commission, the buyer would end up paying a total of $2,080 ($20 x 100 shares + $80 commission). The seller would receive $2,000 while the broker earns $80 in commission.\n\nIn an initial public offering (IPO), the seller (i.e., the company offering the shares) often pays the commission instead of the buyer. So, in this case, the buyer might purchase 100 shares for $2,000 with a 7% commission, while the broker pockets a commission of $140. The seller would receive a total of $1,860. \n\nHowever, it could be argued that the buyer ultimately pays the commission either way, as the seller factors in the commission cost in their pricing. Generally, typical trades direct the buyer to negotiate the commission with the broker, whereas in an IPO purchase, the seller negotiates the commission with the underwriter.\n\nAn IPO has more parties earning commission than a typical trade. The broker still gets a commission from the buyer, and the underwriter gets a commission from the seller. In addition, the broker has to manage the negotiation of the share price, which could increase multiple times before the buyer gives an authorization to purchase. Even then, the buyer may not get the exact number of shares they requested.\n\nDespite the higher commission fees, buying an IPO could be beneficial if the stock price increases after the purchase. But it is important to note that the underwriter's interest is mainly in maximizing their return by convincing buyers to pay a higher price, even if it means overpricing the stock. This could lead to the stock price falling immediately after the IPO. Therefore, buyers need to be cautious and well-informed before deciding to purchase an IPO.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that the numbers given in the text may not be accurate in today's market, as online brokers are highly competitive and may charge a flat fee instead of a percentage. The book may have provided these numbers based on an older period. Commission rates may also vary between the buyer and the seller or across different brokers."}

{"1451": "\n\nI would suggest establishing a landlord/tenant relationship instead of joint ownership. This approach is simpler and more straightforward, with one person taking on full ownership and the other assuming the role of renter. As the landlord, you can propose a monthly rental rate, and the other party can choose to rent or decline. Alternatively, you can both offer a secret rental price, and the landlord with the lower offer will be chosen.\n\nIf you are unable to afford a down payment, the renter's contribution can be considered an unsecured loan, with agreed-upon interest rates and payment schedules. If you both must have names on the financing, it's advisable to sell or refinance the property under one name as soon as possible should the relationship end. At this point, any remaining loan balance should be repaid to the renter, and the landlord will remain responsible for any equity or debt resulting.\n\nIf you anticipate that the unsecured loan will outlast your relationship, then you're either partnering on a home you can't afford, or you're partnering with someone you shouldn't. In either case, it's essential to consider a landlord/tenant relationship instead of joint ownership."}

However, these strategies should not be attempted until you've gained some experience. Even if you're making consistent profits early on, your focus should not be solely on making money. The real challenge is avoiding losses. These risky strategies require a deep understanding of risk management, which takes time to develop. Therefore, it's best to start with stocks with little to no margin. You can still make good returns by buying stocks that dip for temporary reasons that don't affect the company's long-term profitability. Look for events that cause predictable reactions in the market, such as lawsuits or recalls. Learn how to gather, manipulate, and analyze data to improve your decision making. Also, cultivate your analytical thinking skills and don't rely solely on others' advice. Finally, learn to manage your emotions and comprehend risks to avoid losing your investments.

{"1460": "\n\nAccording to economic theory, when demand for a good arises, two markets are created: a spot market for immediate needs and a futures market for future needs. The futures market enables buyers to agree on a pre-approved price, even if the good in question does not yet exist, such as with grain crops. As a natural extension of the futures market, options allow the buyer to have the right to say \"no\" when the contract falls due if the negotiated price is too high based on the actual spot price. This reduces the risk of paying more than necessary and protects buyers against potentially large losses.\n\nFor example, Coors Brewing Company may seek to buy 50 tons of barley grain for delivery in December to supply its upcoming sports events. To avoid paying more than the grain is worth, Coors requests the right to back out of the contract if the price risese. The co-op supplying the grain has a choice to make. If Coors defaults on the contract, the co-op could lose significantly if they had already made investments based on the contract price. Therefore, the co-op requests an option price to cover potential losses in the event Coors exercises the option.\n\nThe option price is based on a simple formula of the probability of Coors exercising the option and the potential losses the co-op would incur if that happened. However, accurately predicting these two figures requires advanced analysis and forecasting, which keeps actuaries busy. Ultimately, if the option price is reasonable, both parties can reach an agreement that benefits them both."}

To ensure I had the best currency exchange rates and no fees on credit card transactions, I obtained a 28 Degrees credit card, which is highly recommended for travel. However, I found that the Malaysian economy relies mainly on cash transactions, especially in non-urban areas. Consequently, I ended up making several cash withdrawals from my credit card, resulting in cash advance fees ($4) and a high interest rate (22%) on the withdrawn amount. Throughout my trip, I made five withdrawals, resulting in fees of approximately $21 - which was far from ideal. \n\nDuring my previous travels, I used a Commonwealth Bank Travel Money Card, which was not the best option, as it charged high fees for a higher exchange rate.

{"1465": "\n\nWhether investing in the company is wise or not depends on various factors. It is essential to analyze the risks associated with the investment thoroughly. For instance, if the company offers great value and its current price is lower than its actual worth, investing in it could prove financially beneficial.

As such, job security may not be a cause for concern even if the investment does not yield the desired returns.\n\nOn the other hand, investing a considerable sum of money in the company can increase your risk of loss. This is because, as an employee, you are already receiving remuneration from the company. It is advisable to avoid overinvesting as it could adversely impact your finances in the event of any negative development that could lead to the company's failure. Several analysts predict a possible recession for the tech industry, partly due to the impact of the NSA. Jesse Colombo, who accurately predicted the housing bubble phenomenon, has also predicted a tech bubble that may cause significant damage when it pops.

Furthermore, if you choose to pay in cash, the salesperson may try to be firmer with you during price negotiation as they are taking a hit on their commission.\n\nIf you decide to pay in cash, the salesperson may become frustrated with you. However, in some cases, the dealer may offer to pay off the finance for you so that you can pay directly in cash while still receiving the bank referral reward.

{"1469": "\n\nThis question has previously been asked and answered. Generally speaking, owning a car tends to be more cost-effective than leasing one. This is due to the fact that leasing agreements are structured to benefit the leasing company and turn a profit. Car companies that do not prioritize creating profits for themselves will typically not remain in business very long. Essentially, it is a zero-sum game, and the lessee/client is typically on the losing end. The majority of the customer losses stem from maintenance expenses and instances of damage or accidents. In both cases, leasing arrangements are designed to yield a significant profit for the owner. The average customer often assumes these will not be issues, but they tend to underestimate the losses they might incur with maintenance expenses. For instance, if two oxygen sensors need to be replaced, and the cost to do so independently would have been $800, but the leasing company charges $1200, the difference of $400 results in a loss for the client. In the event of a total loss, the customer will potentially lose thousands of dollars. Leasing contracts are structured to benefit the owner, not the client. Additionally, leasing agents profit from \u201crequired maintenance.\u201d Such contracts necessitate lessees to perform maintenance activities like oil changes, tire rotations, and more. Manufacturers recalls are also common with newer cars, and those are also required. However, few people actually perform these tasks correctly, giving the agent an excuse to charge the customer thousands of dollars upon the car's return. Bills that range from $4000 to $6000 on a three-year lease for failure to perform required upkeep are common. It is crucial to note that agents profit from such items, which appear as though the deal is excellent when the customer first walks through the door. The primary advantage of leasing is that it requires less money upfront and is more convenient for people who want to switch to a different car without the need to sell the car."}
{"1470": "\n\nRevised: It is important to note that market orders do not receive priority over limit orders. In price/time order matching, the only factor that matters is the time at which an order arrives, provided that the prices match. For instance, let's consider a scenario where the best available sell for AAPL is $100.01 and the best available buy is $100.00. If a limit buy for $100.01 and a market buy arrive simultaneously, the matching engine will receive them one at a time, regardless of how closely they arrive. Suppose the limit buy arrives first, the matching engine will check for any matching sell at $100.01, and a trade will occur if there is one. This happens before the matching engine sees the market buy, which it will then process accordingly. In the same vein, if the market buy arrives first, the matching engine will match it with the best available sell at $100.01, and a trade will occur before processing the limit buy. Therefore, there is no comparison between the two orders or their \"priorities\" because they never exist in the system at the same time. The first order to arrive gets priority over the second, which the matching engine processes afterwards."}

In the past, physical delivery was the norm, but in recent decades, cash-settled contracts have become more popular, particularly among traders.\n\nTo make such trades, a brokerage firm can be used to even out bets between parties, with the firm charging a small premium for the service of making the market.

Other carriers do not behave this way. It is not a prudent or reasonable policy. It creates trouble for members, who must figure out which provider will receive the check. They may have to forward the payment themselves or may assume Anthem has made a mistake on their monthly premium, resulting in thousands of dollars in debt.

It is important to visit credit unions or community banks in person and speak with a loan officer.

Sometimes, shortening the loan term can result in a lower interest rate, but this may not always be the case. Regardless, ensure that you are financially capable of repaying the loan quickly, regardless of the term to which you agree. It is possible that different banks may have varying policies, so it is recommended that you talk to at least two of them, even if the first one provides terms that appease you.

{"1479": "\n\nCar loans generally have lower interest rates compared to personal loans. However, with the increase in competition, some lenders now offer car loans with rates as low as 1.99%, half of the typical mortgage rate. On the other hand, personal loans usually come with rates between 10-14%. It is unlikely that any financial institution will offer a personal loan secured by a car, and it may be against company policies. Some people focus on maximizing their credit score but achieving a high score doesn't necessarily equate to wealth. A sufficiently high score will ensure access to lower rates, but income will always be the limiting factor when it comes to borrowing. Optimizing credit score can be complex as the algorithm used is continuously evolving, and strategies that work today may not be effective in the future. Instead, people should focus on improving other aspects of their personal finance, such as increasing their income or obtaining higher investment returns."}
{"1480": "\n\nTL;DR: Changing when you get paid based on tax bracket information provided by Ben Miller can result in a maximum difference of $6,761 total, or about 4% of your average annual salary. In a specific case where someone is paid $87,780 annually, the difference in taxes paid between two scenarios of when they receive their pay is only $230 total, or less than 1% of their average annual salary.\n\nLet's further explore how brackets work by examining the differences that could result from changing your pay schedule. For someone earning $87,780 annually, their yearly tax payment is $17,716 (which includes $5,183 + $12,532, amounting to 25% of the portion of their income over $37,650). If this person received nothing one year and then doubled their salary the next to $175,560, their tax payment for the second year would be $42,193 (which includes $18,558 + $23,634, amounting to 28% of the portion of their income over $91,150).\n\nHowever, if this person adjusted their pay schedule, they could potentially see a maximum difference of $6,761 in total taxes paid, or $3,380 per year. In the specific case where they are paid $87,780 annually, shifting their pay schedule would result in a difference of only $230 total (or $115 per year) in taxes paid. This amounts to less than 1% of their average annual salary and could be either paying $35,432 total or $14,948 followed by $20,714 for $35,662 total."}

In fact, there are many native adult speakers in the US who cannot write as eloquently as you can. I appreciate your ambition and determination to save money and improve your situation. It's wise that you are considering moving your funds to a more stable currency. However, your salary poses a significant challenge as banks in the US and EU usually require high minimum deposits. Saving up before opening an account may be necessary.\n\nTo address your query, it's extremely prudent to save money in different jars. My wife and I use a similar concept for our savings. Although we have one primary household savings account, we break it down into various categories using a spreadsheet. We allocate certain amounts for vacation, emergencies, or luxury items. Additionally, we have separate business and personal accounts. To manage our day-to-day expenses, we employ the envelope system. After our paycheck is deposited, we withdraw cash and divide it into different envelopes earmarked for various expenses, such as groceries, entertainment, and so on.\n\nIn conclusion, I think you have a sound financial plan, and I would be excited to see how you can increase your income."}
{"1482": "\n\nFrom any angle, this is a bad idea. Cars are a depreciating asset - they gradually diminish in value and are ultimately disposable. The greater the initial cost, the more value they will lose. For instance, if you buy a car worth $100,000, its worth will have dropped to less than $50,000 in four years.* That's a significant amount of money to lose in such a brief time. Not only that, but you will also have to pay for expensive insurance policies to protect such an expensive car. If you have your heart set on this kind of vehicle, it would be prudent to save up the money needed and avoid taking out a loan. \n\nHere's why. If you exclusively save $1,300 each month ($16,000 annually) for six and a half years, then you may have enough cash to purchase this car. It's a lot of money for a long-term goal, but if you save consistently throughout this time, you will be free to spend it as you desire. In addition, you'll have had enough time to reassess your options and may have decided that you don't want to spend all that money on a car. Though you may find yourself reconsidering your plan in the first year or so, you will have already made a significant sacrifice, but at least that money's still yours. But if you opt for a loan instead, you'll find yourself upside down on the payments, unable to sell the car for the same amount and lose thousands of dollars in the process. Start by saving diligently, and if you stick with it and achieve your goal, you may have second thoughts about using that hard-earned cash on a car. Consider a different goal, such as investing the $1,300 each month, getting 8% growth and becoming a millionaire in 23 years.\n\n* You can check this by visiting kbb.com and looking up the private sale value of the particular car you're interested in for the 2012 model. Chances are high that you'll find it's worth about half the cost of a new one."}

However, I can provide some general advice on how to approach this situation. One potential issue you may encounter is being considered an employer if you collect a single check to distribute among tutors. If this is the case, you would be responsible for various employer-related obligations, such as payroll taxes, workers' compensation insurance, and benefits. Even if you are not considered an employer, you will still be paying the tutors, and if anyone receives over $600 in a year, you must issue a 1099 form. You should also obtain a taxpayer identification number for your organization and provide it to the school to ensure they issue the correct tax forms. You may need to register a \"Doing Business As\" name, and if you choose to have the school write the check to you as an individual, you will need to deduct payments to other tutors from your income. If your organization already has a separate tax identity, you could use that to receive payment. It's important to note that the organization would be responsible for paying income tax on any payments received and may deduct expenses such as payments to tutors and marketing costs. If possible, consider having the school pay your organization for its services, and then you can distribute payments to tutors yourself. To do so, you will need to provide the school with necessary information such as the name, address, Social Security number, and cost or hours worked for each tutor."}

In my case, I tend to buy and hold stocks for a long time. For instance, I purchased IBM shares in eighth grade in 1980, and I still own them today. Initially, the stock did not experience much growth over thirteen years, but it paid dividends regularly. However, over the following twenty years, it grew by 1800% and continued to pay dividends. Therefore, I agree with other posters that the saying \"pigs get slaughtered\" is unwise, as it merely benefits fund managers. For instance, if you had bought AAPL at $8 and sold at $12, you would have missed out on its subsequent growth to $600 and its 7-1 stock split, with its present value at $120.

{"1485": "\n\nRevised: The \"constructive receipt doctrine\" determines that a check made payable to a qualified charity and delivered, including being placed in the mail on December 31st, is considered delivered when it's outside the donor's hands. In contrast, for non-charitable gifts such as gifts to family members, the date that the check is cashed (honored by the receiving bank) is relevant. This is significant because the annual gift exclusion is limited to a specific year. For instance, gifting a child $14,000 using a check written on December 31st, 2014, but with a deposit date of January 3rd, 2015, would be attributed to the following year. Therefore, no further gift is allowed to be given to the child for the rest of the year. It's worth noting that the annual gift amount encompasses both cash and non-cash gifts. It's not commonly known that exceeding the annual gift exclusion can be problematic. For example, gifting $14,000 in cash to a child and giving Christmas gifts worth $1,000 to the same person would exceed the annual gift exclusion limit for that child. However, there are options to avoid this issue, such as giving $14,000 to each person. If married, each spouse can also gift $14,000 to each child and their spouse, as well as to each of their children if they have any."}

{"1490": "\n\nEconomically speaking, purchased and rented real estate are not perfect substitutes since they represent largely separate markets. Switching from one to the other is difficult for most people, and once a house is bought, it takes a significant increase in prices for it to be worthwhile to sell and move into an apartment. Although both markets have a supply and demand curve, the demand curve for purchasing a house is much steeper than that of renting. The market for new housing fluctuates rapidly, as it takes a large change in housing prices to alter the number of potential buyers. Most homebuying decisions are not driven by the current state of the market. This creates a demand curve with a steep slope. Additionally, the demand for houses depends substantially on relatively small changes in interest rates and loan availability since mortgages provide leverage. Therefore, the steep demand curve shifts frequently as borrowing conditions change.\n\nOn the other hand, apartment prices are more stable because people can quickly move from one apartment to another or from their parents' house into an apartment if prices change. The quantity demanded of rentals responds reasonably to small changes in price or quantity. This represents a shallow demand curve. Furthermore, rentals are not as tightly tied to interest rates or economic conditions as purchasing a home. For example, during a recession, people avoid homebuying but continue to rent."}
{"1491": "\n\nRevised: Although these cars may be considered outdated, they are less likely to be stolen and offer reasonable safety. To ensure reliability, choose a model with a good reputation and check for common old models at your local junkyard. Although car maintenance may require effort and investment, learning how to fix simple problems yourself can save you money in the long run. Begin by identifying simple faults and diagnosing issues on your own as this can be a costly process when done by a professional. Since all cars sold in the US from 1996 have a required connection, most 1995 manufactured cars will likely have this connector worldwide. Connect your OBD2 adapter to this port and use an app on your phone to determine any faults and clear fault codes to ensure the problem is solved. Your mechanic should also use this when servicing your car. You can find used manuals being sold from service centers or yard sales that can provide you with service notes and even handwritten notes to assist you with your repairs. Most parts from scrapped cars are still in good working condition and can be easily removed for your use. Ensure you purchase good parts since your main income should come from the work performed on your car, not the markup on spare parts. Preferably, choose specialized mechanics who work with a specific brand of cars as they are more knowledgeable about your car and can acquire original spare parts. Turn off the AC when it's not necessary to save gas by disabling the AC compressor. Accelerate quickly instead of slowly to save more gas, allowing your speed to decline on uphills to regain speed once the road levels out. Ensure your car is healthy by checking for worn out parts that can harm your mileage. Reading your owner's manual can help you understand your vehicle's features and ensure it works as intended. Taking care of your car will benefit not only yourself but also your fellow commuters on the road."}

Counties assess all recorded deeds to determine which properties require this reappraisal. The assessor's office may also discover ownership changes through other means like taxpayer self-reporting, field inspections, or reviews of building permits and newspapers. Proposition 13 requires county assessors to reassess the property to its current fair market value as of the date ownership changed. This current market value is used to determine property taxes, which may increase if the new market value is higher than the previously assessed base year value.

Alternatively, it could be a typographical error, although recent quarters for Microsoft have consistently used non-GAAP figures. Microsoft states that the discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue is primarily due to deferred revenue from Windows and Halo. Confirming this, MSFT's SEC filing included the GAAP numbers but not the non-GAAP figures. I should note that the 10Q filing is not the only source of information, which can be shown by Oracle's figures. For example, during March 2016, Oracle had revenues of $0.50/share GAAP/$0.64/share non-GAAP, but the NASDAQ page shows $0.59/share for that quarter. My assumption is that Zacks does extra work and incorporates specific numbers that should be in the revenue stream, but aren't included in the GAAP figures.

This means that if you aren't certain you'll be with the company until an IPO, the options could essentially be worthless. The safest way to value stock options is to assume that they have zero value until exercised. However, with companies like Google and Facebook, stock options can be exercised and sold immediately on the public market. Some companies may even offer stock grants that allow you to sell a portion of the grant to pay taxes, and then sell the remainder for cash even after leaving the company. As long as the options/grants have vested, valuing them at current stock price is a reasonable estimate of future value. If you are confident you will stay with the company through an IPO, you may wish to value the stock based on earnings. For example, a $10 million profit could easily justify a $100 million IPO market capitalization. Dividing that by the number of shares outstanding and multiplying by the number of shares you hold can provide a conservative estimate of the value of your options. Nevertheless, big company offers that are immediately tradeable are typically more favorable than those contingent on an IPO. If you leave the company before the IPO, you may receive nothing, and if the IPO is delayed, you may be unable to leave the company without forfeiting part of your compensation, which can be a significant commitment to make."}

{"1511": "\n\nInvesting in index-tracking funds for the long-term generally poses relatively low risk compared to short-term speculation. However, it is still a higher risk than money-market investments, savings accounts, or bonds. This is because the return is not guaranteed and losses are not limited. Volatility and general market conditions play a part in this risk, although volatility also affects bonds to some extent. While long-term trends may be upwards, short-term trends can vary significantly. For example, the S&P500 lost value in 2008, resulting in investors who liquidated their investments in November 2008 after investing in November 1998 ending up with no gain or even a loss. If they had waited just one more year, or liquidated a year earlier, the result would have been significantly different. This is an example of volatility risk. Even with long-term investments, you can't invest indefinitely; at some point, you'll need to liquidate your investment. Higher volatility means a higher chance of a downward spike, potentially killing your gains, even if the general trend over the surrounding period was upward.

Be cautious of any car dealership that claims to offer a solution to this problem. The business practices of some dealerships in the United States, which sell cars on loans to people who cannot afford them, were recently exposed in a video by Jon Oliver from \"Last Week Tonight.\" Deals that seem too good to be true are usually just that. After a few months, the victims customers end up with no car but a mountain of debt.\n\nOne way to determine if you can afford a car is by calculating the monthly cost of ownership. A new car usually lasts for about 10-20 years, so divide the price by 120 to get the monthly cost of buying the car. However, this only covers the vehicle cost and not the additional monthly expenses, such as gas, repairs, insurance, taxes, etc., which depend on your usage pattern and location. If your monthly disposable income is less than the purchase and running costs, you cannot afford the car.\n\nThere are other alternatives to explore if you cannot afford your dream car."}
{"1517": "\n\nThe current state of modern portfolio theory is that it has underestimated the risk associated with recommended assets. This discrepancy occurs due to the limited number of underlying assets within the recommended section of the curve. Whenever investors identify such assets, substantial amounts of funds get poured into them. This causes a temporary reduction in measured risk and increases measured return. However, as time progresses, the market becomes saturated, eventually leading to a crowded trade. At this point, an influx of capital tries to exit the trade into cash or the next discovered asset. As a result, the measurable risk rises, and the measured return drops abruptly. In short, modern portfolio theory can create bubbles that eventually burst. As a solution, other investment strategies should be considered."}

{"1523": "\n\nIf there are better investment alternatives, taking out a loan with a modest interest rate may be more advantageous than paying in cash. For instance, let's examine the scenario of purchasing a house. There are two extremes to consider: a) buying the house outright in cash, or b) financing the entire purchase with a bank loan. Historically, house prices (adjusted for inflation) have not significantly increased in the long run in the United States. Therefore, investing all of your own capital in this manner might not be the most optimal decision. It's important to note that we're assuming in both scenarios that you'll be living in the house - rent savings are not impacted. However, if you were purchasing a house as a separate investment for renting out, then you would receive rent. With Scenario a), your capital's real return would be zero, whereas with Scenario b), you can invest the cash in the stock market and earn an average of 7% annually (the stock market has yielded a 7% real return annually including dividends) minus the bank's interest rate. If the interest rate is less than 7%, it might be profitable to take out the loan. Of course, the final decision depends on your risk preference."}

Firstly, your broker cannot take action on the calls you have sold as they do not own them nor can they opt to exercise them. While your broker can liquidate positions during margin calls, this scenario would not result in a margin call since short calls covered by long stock have no margin requirement. Hence, your broker has no right to take any action against you unless you have bought something on margin that has caused a margin call. If you are concerned about the person who owns the long calls, they can impact you by exercising their right to buy the stock from you. However, since the options are not in the money, it is unlikely they will exercise them before expiration, if at all. This is because most options trade above their intrinsic value, and in this case, the option allows the owner to buy the stock at the same price as anyone in the market, making it irrational to exercise. Selling the call and buying the stock in the market would be a better strategy for the owner."}

The reason for this warning is due to the reckless utilization of deposited funds and other public monies for constructing buildings, which is solely intended to boost the country's GDP.

As a result, all depositors in Chinese banks are at substantial risk of losing access to their funds, or at least ending up with their assets frozen. This is mostly because all funding used for real estate construction comes from banks, and to a lesser degree, taxes and land seizures.

{"1535": "\n\nBased on the feedback received regarding the mortgage costs of your various options, I will address the remaining half of the question. Please note that while my assumptions may not be completely accurate, they are still useful for comparison purposes. \n\nAssuming you make your mortgage payment and then contribute the remainder to savings, this is where you will stand after 30 years. Surprisingly, the 30 year mortgage results in $40k less in savings, but a $20k higher balance. The reason for this is the effect of compounding interest. When you contribute more money to savings at a faster rate, it usually works in your favor, as long as your savings venue generates a higher rate of return than the cost of the debt. \n\nIf the yield on your savings drops to 3%, the 30 year mortgage will net you $264,593, while the 15 year option yields $283,309. If, on the other hand, your savings yield increases to 10% (not unheard of for a strong mutual fund), the 30 year option nets $993,418, while the 15 year option comes out at $684,448. \n\nTherefore, while it is true that you will pay more interest on a 30 year mortgage, having a solid investment portfolio, and making consistent contributions, will ultimately result in greater savings in the long run. However, it is crucial that your investments earn more than the interest on your loan. If your debt is costing you more than your investment is earning, it's better to pay off your debt first. In reality, you need your investments to outperform both the interest on your debt and inflation to stay ahead overall. \n\nPersonally, I would suggest looking for investments that generate at least an 8% annual return, and choosing the 30 year mortgage option. Please note, however, that all investments involve risk, and there is no guarantee of reaching any particular earnings target."}

The SNB has now pledged to print as much as necessary to achieve its desired peg to the Euro, and the Franc's value has fallen. With all major central banks participating in a currency devaluation contest, inflation is expected to rise significantly. This development may not significantly impact the European financial crisis as most government debts are in Euros.

{"1539": "\n\nDefined contribution and defined benefit are two types of pension plans. In defined contribution plans, you or your employer contribute a set amount, and you are responsible for any investment returns. In contrast, in defined benefit plans, your employer promises to pay you a specified amount, and they are responsible for making the necessary investments to provide for it.\n\nThere is no clear answer as to which plan is better. Defined benefit plans offer more predictable and assured benefits, but they rely on the employer to have saved enough money to pay that amount. If the employer fails to do so, the only fallback is government guarantees, which have limitations. On the other hand, people control their own defined contribution accounts, which are always fully funded. Defined benefit pension plans are often underfunded, and the employer is expected to subsidize them when they run short.\n\nIf you prefer having someone else make promises to you and aren't worried that they won't keep them, you may prefer defined benefit plans. If you want to have personal control over your money, you may prefer defined contribution plans. Some see defined benefit plans as the gold standard of pensions, while others view them as risky and encouraging false promises.\n\nIn my personal opinion, defined benefit plans are a curse as they encourage risky behavior and false promises. In contrast, defined contribution plans are more honest about what they provide and better match the production of employment with its compensation."}

Additionally, you have encountered issues with Alternative Minimum Tax (C).\n\nWhile point A suggests a straightforward tax return, points B and C indicate a more complicated situation. If the employer stock is not handled correctly, there could be under-withholding, resulting in issues with AMT. In a simple tax situation where income doesn't fluctuate much, the standard deduction is taken, and the number of exemptions corresponds to the number of family members, the withholding should be accurate.

Therefore, it is unlikely that the IRS places significant value on this metric, and I agree with others who do not view it as authoritative."}
{"1544": "\n\nBonds are valued based on the concept of the \"time value of money\". This means that money now is worth more than money later due to the potential to earn a return between those two time periods. For example, consider a bond with a par value of $100 that will mature in 10 years with a 0% coupon rate. If a company or government issuing these bonds needs one million dollars and investors expect a 5% rate of return, each bond would only sell for about $62. To receive $1 million now, the bond issuer would need to sell $1.62 million in bonds. These calculations are based on equations that determine the future and present values of investments. The percentage of rate of return is referred to as the \"yield\" or \"discount rate\", depending on what is being calculated and other factors such as inflation.\n\nTo reduce the amount paid by the bond issuer, many opt for \"coupon bonds\". These bonds have a \"coupon rate\" that determines the amount of the \"coupon payment\". This is akin to making interest-only payments on a credit card balance. By making these payments periodically, the bond issuer avoids interest compounding. From an accounting standpoint, the coupon rate lowers the amount of actual money paid. In the previous example, $1 million in bonds with a 5% coupon rate would only require a total payment of $1.5 million. The interest payments would be paid annually or semi-annually, totaling half a million dollars. From a finance perspective, the present value of coupon payments plus the maturity payout is higher with a coupon bond compared to a bond that only pays out at maturity.\n\nCoupon rates are beneficial to bond issuers because they simplify the bond package. For instance, if a small business needs $1 million for a project and is willing to repay it with a 5% interest rate in 10 years, they can issue $1 million worth of bonds with a 5% coupon rate and maturity in 10 years. Whether or not the market accepts this rate depends on the market's assessment of risk. If investors perceive the business as a good investment, they may buy the bonds for more than their face value. However, if they view the business as a poor investment, they will seek a higher rate of return. The purchase price will reflect the present value of all coupon and maturity payments."}

The same goes for your savings account\u2014combining and tracking them is much easier than having multiple separate accounts. \n\nHowever, when it comes to retirement, it's essential to have both tax-wise retirement accounts (such as a 401(k) or IRA) and post-tax regular brokerage accounts. In my personal situation, I've found that the Schwab non-retirement account works well for emergency funds (with money market funds) and savings (with CDs of different maturities). \n\nDespite simplifying wherever possible, my wife and I still each have a 401(k), an IRA, and a Roth IRA. I have an inherited Roth, and I manage my teen's Roth and brokerage accounts. That adds up to nine accounts, which is difficult to reduce. Therefore, my recommendation is to go back to the first four accounts and use the #4 checking account attached to the broker account as the emergency fund. That way, you'd only have three accounts. Any further granularity can be achieved with a spreadsheet. \n\nIn closing, simplification is crucial, but it's essential to consider individual circumstances, as everyone's financial situation is unique.

I respectfully disagree with the assertion of \"absurdism\" on Google Finance, as I see a vertical differential on the price axis, which represents the same percentage change in price, regardless of its placement.

While certain insurance products may claim to provide coverage for your mortgage, they often come with various loopholes that can make them difficult to collect on. Insurance companies aim to make a profit, and as such, premiums can be high in anticipation of potential claims. Instead, it may be more beneficial to divide those premiums between your mortgage and building your own self-insured unemployment fund, such as an emergency fund in a money market bank account. It's also important to ensure that you have ideal term life insurance coverage for your family, as well as long-term disability insurance should an unfortunate situation arise in the near future. When contemplating a home purchase, it's wise to keep in mind that a longer-term stay in the area, say five years or more, may be necessary to justify the investment.

If a broker has trades on both sides (buy and sell), they can offset the volumes against each other and profit from the spread, while using the posted margins to cover profits and losses from both sides. Since settlement for most securities is not immediate, issuers may buy the security without the intention of taking delivery and sell it at the end of the day to pass delivery on to another party, ultimately profiting from the spread. Additionally, issuers receive low commissions on their volumes, lowering their costs compared to the value of the spread. However, if they cannot net the position, the spreads will be wider. Although issuers may occasionally be required to purchase the security outright, it is rare, and this results in even wider spreads to ensure they can make a decent profit."}

The preference for a \"friendly merger\" involves making a tender offer to the board of directors or direct owners of a private company. If this fails, the buying company resorts to making a tender offer on the open market to acquire 51% of the total shares. Market cap is not considered, as one can own 100% of it and still lack a majority holding. A company with less than 51% of its shares on the public market may have private shareholders that need to be convinced to sell. If the company is at risk of a hostile takeover, it may take measures to resist it. However, the shareholder voting body may reject these measures if they believe the takeover will benefit them. Holdouts who did not sell their stocks during a successful merger may be forced to sell at the tender price or exchange for equivalent stock in the buying company."}
{"1559": "\n\nIt's actually quite simple. You seem to be confusing two concepts: taking a short position and short selling itself. Taking a short position involves selling a stock in the belief that it will drop, but whether or not you buy it back later depends on whether you think it will rise again. When you take a short position, you don't profit from the drop in price, but you also don't lose any money.\n\nHowever, if you believe a specific company or the market in general is going to drop and you want to profit from that drop, simply buying stock won't work because that is going long. To make a profit, you need to buy low and sell high. Selling high is easy, but to buy low, you need to acquire the stock somehow. You can borrow it from someone and then sell it, promising to return it later. When the price drops, you can buy the stock back at a lower price and return it to the lender, making a profit on the difference.\n\nThis strategy is known as short selling, which is a type of short position. Some hedge funds use multiple strategies and algorithms to optimise their transactions and reduce borrowing fees. However, there is always a risk involved, and it's important to keep that in mind. It is possible to lend yourself the stock, but this only makes sense if done properly and with a solid plan in place."}

This allows them to avoid the currency exchange fees for USD-quoted shares listed on the NYSE. If Shopify is offering only one class of shares to the public in the IPO (Class A subordinate voting shares as indicated in Shopify's form F-1), then the shares that will trade on both the TSX and NYSE will be the same class, and therefore identical. The major difference will be the currency in which they are quoted and traded, offering another dimension to possible arbitrage, which could result in price deviations between exchanges due to currency fluctuation. A company that maintains a dual listing will need to follow the requirements of both the TSX and NYSE. This may have a hard cost in terms of additional filing requirements, but it can benefit them from increased liquidity from multiple listings. Moreover, Canadians are more likely to invest in a Canadian company with a TSX listing quoted in CAD. Additionally, a company listed on both the TSX and NYSE is more likely to be included in a significant market index based on market capitalization. This benefits the company because its shares would be bought by index ETFs and index mutual funds.

To decrease this risk, brokers offer stop-limit orders. This type of order comprises a trigger price and a minimum price acceptable for your shares, reducing the likelihood of selling at an undesirable price. Yet, if a flash crash happens, and other sellers lower stock prices beyond your set limit, your order may remain unexecuted, and you'll be left with depreciated shares. For stocks that are relatively stable and liquid, either option is suitable, but for uncertain and less liquid securities, a stop-limit order provides a more safeguarded approach.

However, a decline in the European share price can offset the currency risk, leaving the ADR share price unchanged.

Calculate all of your income sources such as wages and allowances, and all of your expenses including rent, utilities, loan repayments, food, and both essentials and luxuries. If your income is greater than your expenses, you are off to a good start. On the other hand, if your expenses exceed your income, trouble may lie ahead. Either increase your income, reduce your expenses, or both. Examine your expenses, cut back on luxuries, discover less costly alternatives for necessities, and obtain a second job or increase your hours at your current position. The goal is always to have more income than you spend. Secondly, pay off outstanding debts by paying more than the minimum amounts and establish savings objectives. For example, you may want to set aside money for a car or create a six-month emergency fund (a dedicated account with enough funds to support you for six months in case of job loss or illness). Consider earning a higher education degree to qualify for better-paying positions. When you earn more, avoid overspending on luxuries; indulge yourself, yet be responsible. Increase the amount you save and learn to invest to improve the return on your savings. Establishing a solid financial future requires hard work and self-control.

For example, if Mr. B gifts his wife an antique table he purchased for \u00a312,000 in 2003, and his wife spends \u00a3500 in restoration, eventually selling the table for \u00a320,000 - her total cost will be \u00a312,500 (\u00a3500 restoration plus Mr. B\u2019s \u00a312,000 cost). Mrs. B\u2019s gain is then \u00a37,500 (\u00a320,000 minus \u00a312,500 in costs).\n\nIf you gift an asset to a family member or someone you are connected with, you must determine the gain or loss.

Check the \u2018Capital Gains Tax and connected persons\u2019 link for more information.\n\nIt is essential to obtain an asset valuation at the time of the gift.

As explained here, it should be: On the other hand, as explained here: Cap rate compares two investments by using a reverse unit cost approach. For example, if House A costs $1M and generates a yearly profit of $50K, while House B costs $1.33M and generates a yearly profit of $65K, you can compute the cap rates to determine that House A is a more efficient investment based on income vs. the amount invested. Unlike cap rate, profit margin primarily considers ongoing expenses rather than the total investment. If the cost of maintaining Property B is lower than that of Property A, you could have a scenario like: Thus, Property B is a more efficient investment based on the fraction of revenue you preserve annually. Factoring in the property's value as an opportunity cost could lead to a more comprehensive net profit margin calculation that accounts for all aspects of the investment. Accountants and economists handle such calculations routinely. :-)"}

{"1604": "\n\nRevised: To expand on @keshlam's response, a stock's price comprises several elements, with only the book value on the day that the accounts are prepared being somewhat accurately known. Even cash flows that are completed after the books are prepared may contain uncertainties, as they may be reversed if the stock is returned or reduced by unforeseen expenses. Projecting future cash flows is based on, among other things, anticipated sales for all time. However, even projected future cash flows are subject to risks, as customers may not pay or suppliers may go into liquidation and change their invoicing strategies. Estimating the risk of future cash flows is subjective and depends on the analyst's assessment of the future global economic state. Investors can choose to invest in a risk-free instrument, usually represented by the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, that guarantees a return. However, if they invest in a riskier asset, they must get paid a premium over the risk-free rate to compensate for the additional risk. Determining this premium is subjective and varies significantly based on individual assessments of risks. As none of the factors that influence share price are accurately quantifiable and many are subjective, there is no objectively right share price, particularly during the time of an IPO. Investors can assess these values differently and value shares differently, which can drive share prices to an uncertain level. In response to a question regarding whether there is sufficient information available to determine the share price when a company acquires another company before an IPO, dividing the price paid by the relative ownership structures offers an approximation of the value of the company at a given time. However, it cannot adequately represent the market price as other investors may value the firm differently based on their unique assessments of the above criteria, which will determine share prices."}

While the IRS considers business and selling of cryptoproperty on a case-by-case basis, the amounts involved are often small, so it's advisable to read through IRS publications carefully, make reasonable assumptions, and document tax preparations clearly. If in doubt, choosing an option with higher taxes may prevent objections from the IRS.\n\nNevertheless, this is not legal or tax advice, and it's wise to contact qualified professionals for personalized advice.

{"1606": "\n\nWhile I lack practical experience in this area, I would like to present my academic understanding of business pricing. The liquidation value indicates the lowest amount a seller would accept. For example, in the case of a B&B, this value would be the total worth of the land, property, furnishings, accounts, and any additional assets that can currently be sold, minus any relevant liabilities. The seller's preference is likely to be a multiple of the annual earnings of the business, often determined through a discounted cash flow analysis, which involves calculating the EBITDA (earnings before interest, depreciation, taxation, and amortization) generated by the company. This figure can then be projected forwards into perpetuity, discounted by the going interest rate, or by utilizing an industry multiplier. As an illustration, if the predicted annual earnings of the business are $100,000, growing at a rate of 5%, and considering the prevailing interest rate of 8%, using a growing perpetuity formula would result in a total value of $2,000,000. However, utilizing a multiple of the EBIDTA is a more common method, and the EBIDTA multiplier for the respective industry can be found through research. For example, the 2011 EBIDTA multiplier for the hospitality sector was 13.8. Therefore, the worth of the B&B in question would be approximately $1,380,000. An SME valuation tool is available online to estimate the value of the business based on the EBIDTA multiple. Furthermore, it is worth noting that various small businesses use the Seller Discretionary Earnings (SDE) instead of EBIDTA; both serve comparable functions. To determine the value of the enterprise, a prospective purchaser should examine the financial statements of the company from the previous several years and then engage with the owner in negotiations on pricing. Enlisting the assistance of a broker is recommended for such transactions."}

Some are free to recommend any financial products that they consider appropriate, while others are limited in their recommendations. Most advisers who work for finance companies belong to the latter category and can only offer products that their company sells. Ideally, they should disclose upfront if they fall into the second category, and if asked, they should definitely reveal that they are restricted in their offerings. Therefore, your Scotiabank adviser may not necessarily make poor choices for you, but their options are limited, and they won't disclose if there are better products outside of Scotiabank. The term \"management fees\" typically refers to the fees you pay to the fund managers and not to the person who sells the funds.

Although you can hold onto your bond and wait for its expiration, if you decide to sell it, you'll discover that buyers won't be willing to pay $50 for it anymore.

{"1613": "\n\nRevised: \n\nShort answer: Any financial planning that spans for more than 10 years, such as mortgage and retirement planning.\n\nLong answer: Inflation doesn't have much effect in short time frames as daily expenses can fluctuate. However, over the long term, inflation can significantly impact finances. Although annual inflation rates are typically small (2-4%), unexpected expenses can have a more substantial effect (5-10%). Nevertheless, even these expenses will have a comparatively minor impact (5-10%) over ten years when compared to the impact of compounded inflation (30-40%). Planning for retirement is where inflation becomes critical, and it's best to start planning as early as possible. When making long-term projections, it is necessary to consider both the expected nominal investment return (e.g., 7%) and subtract the expected inflation rate (e.g., 3%) or add inflation to your projected spending. When projecting income over ten years, you can estimate the annual raises using the inflation rate. Before age 30, people tend to receive raises that exceed inflation, but after that, they tend to track inflation. When purchasing a home, calculating the total cost of a 30-year mortgage requires taking inflation into account, along with interest, maintenance, insurance, and closing costs. While inflation can also impact rent and income, it's essential to research specific market rates instead of relying only on average inflation rates to determine your personal rate of inflation. While rent and wages tend to increase in line with inflation over the long term, paying attention to market rates can be profitable in the short term. Over 10-20 years, your actual rate of inflation should be reasonably close to the average rate when considering all of your significant expenses, including housing, food, energy, clothing, etc."}

{"1616": "\n\nI believe that there is no universal answer that applies to this question for all goods. The response depends on the way related businesses operate, your understanding of the actual value of the product, and other factors. For example, your car scenario presents various options; some dealers may buy it as a single transaction, while others may sell it or do a simultaneous sell with a trade-in. On the other hand, my experience with a hot tub was different; I could not locate a dealer who would purchase my used tub, but I could find individuals who could offer a trade-in. Therefore, the available choices for a car and a hot tub are vastly different. While some generic advice may apply, I concur with @keshlam's viewpoint in trying to avoid entrapment. However, I have a marginally dissimilar perspective. To secure the best possible deal, you must have a clear objective in mind and remain dedicated to reaching your target. If the dealer needs to \"move money around\" between the new car and trade-in, I am amenable to this option as long as I achieve my goals. Ideally, I want to handle both transactions simultaneously for simplicity. At the same time, I am flexible enough to take out the trade-in offer if it does not meet my requirements. Additionally, threatening to do so can impart valuable insights into the dealer's assessment of the value between the new car and trade-in since the price on the vehicle will likely modify in response to such a threat."}

Typically, a cash discount on a home purchase averages around 1-2%, all else being equal. However, various circumstances may justify a significantly greater discount, such as a seller in a hurry to close or a home that has been re-listed after a previous sale fell through. Moreover, an owner who overestimates the advantages of a cash offer might also offer a greater discount. Anecdotally, I know of a neighbor who accepted a cash offer 5% below asking, despite receiving multiple offers at the listed price. They opted for the discount to close faster (within 15 days) with no inspection clause. Conversely, I lost a property to a cash offer that also came in at 5% below asking. Despite my offer being above the listed price, I wasn't able to match the cash offer's short-closing period and lack of inspection contingency, resulting in a total cash discount exceeding 5%. While luxury properties may exhibit greater volatility, I don't think this alters the cash versus financed evaluation significantly. I would appreciate it if someone could provide a reliable source for more accurate data. Nonetheless, even with an average, we must keep in mind that it can only offer limited help."}

Option B is to sell your current car and invest the proceeds, which starts at $10,000 and ends with $10,000 plus investment gains. Option C is to use the $10,000 from the sale of your car as a down payment for a new lease, which reduces finance charges but costs $10,000 upfront.\n\nTo determine the overall cost comparison, use Edmunds' True Cost to Own research to find the cost of ownership for your current car over the same term as the lease you're considering.

This increase in borrowing costs affects both consumers and businesses, leading to higher expenses and lower earnings for companies with debt. Additionally, higher interest rates may make the stock market less attractive to investors. However, it's important to consider other factors that could influence the stock market and other investments when analyzing their relationship to the Federal Funds rate.

If there is a lien against a vehicle, its seller does not possess a clear title, and this poses a risk to the buyer. Even if a buyer pays the seller to cover the lien (in the event of a bank loan), there is no guarantee that the seller will pay off the debt, thus the title remains unclear. This article suggests that visiting the bank with the seller to obtain the title on-the-spot is the best approach, but this is not always possible as a local branch may not have the necessary documentation readily available.

Hence, the quotes simply reflect what the investor would receive for simplicity's sake, and it is the investor's responsibility to calculate and pay their own taxes. According to the IRS, ordinary dividends are the most common type of distribution from a corporation or mutual fund, paid out of earnings and profits as ordinary income, not capital gains.

However, there are exceptions to this rule, particularly if you are considered to be conducting a 'trade or business' in the US, or if US real estate is involved. For further information, please refer to the IRS website's section on nonresident aliens, and consult Publication 519 if you have time.

The exact formula for calculating your credit score remains unknown, making it difficult to provide a precise answer. Nonetheless, I strongly advise against applying for 22 or more credit cards in order to hike up this portion of your score."}
{"1640": "\n\nWhen deciding what type of company to form, it is important to consider several factors. Instead of automatically opting for an S-Corporation, it would be wise to research and explore other options such as Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), Limited Partnerships (LPs), or Professional Companies (PCs). Littleadv's assessment of the limited benefits of forming an S-Corp with only two shareholders is accurate. The potential costs associated with forming any type of corporation, including an S-Corp, may outweigh the advantages gained from favorable tax treatment and personal liability protection. Such costs include filing fees and disclosure rules which vary depending on the state in which you operate. For instance, if you're a physician who operates in New Mexico with no employees except for an unpaid family member, forming a PC may be the best choice, while an S-Corp may be more appropriate for operations in a state without personal income taxes, such as Florida. Ultimately, deciding which entity formation is best requires seeking guidance from a qualified accountant who can provide informed counsel."}

{"1642": "You are discussing modern portfolio theory, which seeks to maximize portfolio expected return for a given amount of portfolio risk or minimize risk for a given level of expected return by selecting various assets in carefully chosen proportions. Essentially, you can either pick a level of risk you are comfortable with and find the maximum return achievable without exceeding this risk level, or pick a level of expected return and minimize risk. It is not possible to maximize both simultaneously. For more complex portfolios, quadratic programming techniques are utilized, particularly with securities that cannot be held in fractional amounts and portfolios prohibiting short sales. The covariance matrix is often used to calculate the correlation table. However, although these methods are theoretically sound, putting them into practice can be challenging. It is difficult to come up with a realistic measure of risk levels that satisfies investors as it may depend on the direction of the returns. Furthermore, it is challenging to minimize other forms of risk, such as value at risk. Any actively managed fund that applies these methods will likely use more advanced approaches than the basic strategy typically discussed."}

Since there are less than four months remaining to pay off the amount, the interest accrued is approximately $21. Rather than searching for credit card calculators, it is more practical to use a standard mortgage calculator since the calculation process is essentially the same. However, during the last month, the credit card may calculate the accrued interest differently. Using a financial calculator indicates a total of 3.407 payments or $1022.12 in total, which includes $22.12 in interest. This revised amount is slightly more than my initial estimate of $21."}

One section discusses the concept of \"Breaking the Buck,\" which occurs when the fund fails to return its full dollar. These funds aim to minimize the small fluctuations that may arise in investing in short-term treasuries directly, but they still carry some risk over longer periods. Although some funds have experienced losses during market crashes, even the worst performers have returned 95 cents on the dollar. If you want an investment option with minimal fluctuation and similar low risk to short-term treasuries, then money-market funds are likely the best choice. However, it is essential to consider inflation, as money-market funds generally offer returns similar to or less than the inflation rate. Although these funds can help you avoid the fluctuations of the stock market, the value of your retirement account may fall behind the cost of goods over time. Unless you are close to retirement, most financial professionals suggest that only a small portion of your retirement account be allocated to money market instruments. Vanguard offers a range of target retirement investment funds that closely align with professional recommendations. Consulting a financial professional to discuss your specific needs is also a good option."}

There are many ways for a company to do this, but both of the above examples involve a corporation owning a subsidiary with the same name as the holding company, which sells its own stock on the local market. The home corporation owns the majority holdings of the subsidiary and issues its own stock on its home country's exchange. \n\nIt is also possible for the same company to list shares of the same pool of stock on two different exchanges, usually in the corporation's home currency, with share prices that are near-identical. However, this is much rarer, and it's usually easier for tax liability and other cost purposes to keep American monies in America and Japanese monies in Japan by setting up two subsidiaries.\n\nThe shares of one issue of one company's stock, on one exchange, are the same price regardless of where in the world you place a buy order from. However, this doesn't necessarily mean you'll pay the same actual value of currency for the stock. First, you buy the stock in the listed currency, which means buying dollars (or Yen, Euros, or GBP) with a broker's fee and a fluctuating exchange rate between currencies. \n\nSecond, you'll pay the stock broker a commission, and they may charge different rates for different exchanges depending on the cost of doing business in each place. For example, the broker might need a trader on the floor at each exchange or contract with a foreign broker for a cut of the commission. It's important to consider these fees and commissions when investing in a foreign-listed stock."}

However, if I buy a deep out-of-the-money Jan 2017 $70 strike put for $188 in addition, the margin requirement needed to enter the trade would be $3,400. Alternatively, I could opt for the Jan 2017 $70 strike call for roughly $5,800, but this would require a 100% margin due to its classification as a long call.

Over the next N years, the giver pays off the loan installments for the recipient, with the yearly amount being small enough to avoid triggering Gift Tax. However, it's important to note that income tax must still be paid on the interest received, despite the recipient using the money to pay you back. In addition, a minimum interest rate must be charged, or else you'll be taxed as if the loan was earning that minimum. This method was previously utilized primarily by wealthy individuals due to the high costs associated with legal fees, paperwork and bookkeeping. However, with the prevalence of the internet and the aftermath of the \"Great Recession,\" this method has become more widely known, with services that offer standardized paperwork, lawyer reviews, official mortgage liens, and payments processing services.

However, the underpayment remains the responsibility of the employer, and any reimbursement in this regard is subject to settlement between the employer and the employee. It is important to note that if an employer has withheld an incorrect amount of FICA taxes from an employee, the employer is still responsible for paying those taxes to the government, not the employee. As an employee (and not self-employed), there is no direct way to pay FICA taxes to the government without involving the employer. Therefore, any underwithheld amount can be deducted from future paychecks or resolved by other means between the employer and the employee. It is the employer's responsibility to issue a corrected W-2 if they deduct the underpayment from an employee's future paychecks. However, they cannot issue a corrected W-2 if FICA taxes were not deducted from the employee's pay."}

Comparing Detroit to Orange County, where malfeasance caused bankruptcy, the issue here is a much larger structural problem stemming from the city's declining economy and tax base.

In such cases, it becomes a revenue or contra-expense based on the methodology followed. The purpose of the income statement is to demonstrate net inflows of short-term operational accruals that exclude new borrowing and repaid loans. The cash flow statement offers a clearer depiction of individual cash events like borrowing debt, repaying debt, and bill payments. Although loans cannot be directly associated with bill payments as entities are akin to a single tank filled by multiple inflows and outflows, the cash flow statement shows a cash inflow when booking the new loan under financing and a cash outflow when recording bill payments under operating. With these two transactions, assuming an otherwise empty balance sheet, one could infer that the loan funded the bill payment."}

In fact, it could be considered one of the worst investment options available. Suppose we were to discuss investments over coffee or wine. In that case, it's easy to imagine proposing the idea of identifying the worst possible investment opportunity, and real estate would likely make the top of that list. This proposition remains true even with the current market showing signs of increased activity since it is still reeling from the last bubble that never fully popped. The idea of investing in property is especially unfavorable right now and is likely to remain so for several decades to come. Unlike the early 2000s when demand for houses was high due to the Baby Boom generation buying property, the scenario is unlikely to repeat itself anytime soon. This lack of demand results in oversupply and weak market demand. Any individual buying property as an investment, especially at this time, is advised against it."}

Several commodity-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are readily available on major North American stock exchanges. If you have low-cost access to US markets, this could be a viable option, but be mindful of currency conversion costs.

{"1667": "\n\nI respectfully hold a contrasting viewpoint to the previous respondents. In technical analysis of stock charts, both short and long term moving averages are utilized to indicate the stock's trend in comparison to its current price. The term \"moving average\" (MA) is preferable to simply using \"average\" since MAs recalculate daily or at appropriate frequencies depending on the data period. It is worth elaborating on the term \"moving average\" as there are commonly two types utilized. \n\nTo address the initial question, the value of this number is significant. For instance, if the present price exceeds both the 200-day EWMA and the 30-day EWMA, then the stock is generally trending upwards. However, if the present price is lower than both the 200-day EWMA and 30-day EWMA, then the stock is generally trending downwards. These numbers are chosen based on the market being traded, its volatility, and other relevant factors. For an example of how several moving averages are used in conjunction, consider reading about Daryl Guppy's Multiple Moving Averages, although larger MAs are not employed in this method."}

This is a personal topic that I will be focusing on in the near future as well.\n\nThe challenge with estimating the price of a house is that it's negotiable and there is no sticker price. However, you can gather publicly available information that websites aggregate such as http://www.city-data.com/. Additionally, some heuristics such as rent being at least as expensive as a monthly mortgage, taxes, HOA fees, etc., can help.

In the United States, the term \"head of household\" has a specific definition and is reserved for unmarried individuals who are financially supporting one or more relatives, according to the IRS. If you are employed full-time while your spouse is not, it's likely that you'll file a joint return, which should include all of your combined income and any expenses related to your wife's business.

{"1670": "\n\nEssentially, a 401(k) offers a \"structured withdrawal and repayment agreement\", commonly referred to as a loan, that allows you to access your funds without incurring a 10% penalty or taxes. This loan can provide up to half of your current savings, with a maximum limit of $50k, minus any outstanding loan balances. However, regular payments must be made, and there is an interest rate attached. While the interest goes towards your account, there are restrictions, and you must keep your employment for which you are contributing to the 401(k). If you are no longer employed, the loan balance must usually be repaid within 60 days, or be considered a \"withdrawal\". However, Roth accounts work differently. With Roth accounts, contributions are post-tax, meaning there are no penalties or additional taxes when cashing out. Therefore, if you need cash for unforeseen expenses, it may be better to cash out some of the principal from a Roth account and then make disciplined contributions to replenish it."}

It is unclear if the agreement is for a lump sum payment or installment payments, but in either case, if the lien is not cleared, the bank has the legal right to repossess the car, regardless of who is physically in possession of it.

On average, replacing two outfits a year will cost around $600 (\u00a3400).\n\nEntertainment costs will depend on your interests, but a traditional American date night consisting of a movie and dinner for two can cost between $260-$420 (\u00a3165-\u00a3270) per month. Organized sports can be pricey, especially if you need specialized equipment. Groceries are cheaper in America, and a monthly budget for a family of three is typically around $300-$400 (\u00a3190-\u00a3260).\n\nBased on these factors, you could expect to spend around $335 (\u00a3215) per month on food alone. Alcohol is generally more expensive in the US, and we consume a lot of high-fructose corn syrup-based products that are taxed heavily in Europe. Still, it's safe to say that shopping for American tastes in the UK will cost you around 25-30% more than in the US.\n\nUltimately, the amount you need to live comfortably in Cardiff will depend on your job, lifestyle, interests, and budgeting habits."}

{"1677": "\n\nTo start with, it is advisable to contact your health plan administrator as soon as possible to understand how your plan interacts with Medicare. Since different plans may have different guidelines, any information we provide here may be tentative. There are a number of issues you may encounter while having both Medicare and a QHP. When you have dual primary coverage from Medicare and your QHP, there is no federal law to address this situation. However, state insurance law usually stipulates how health benefits should be coordinated in such cases. Your insurance companies determine which coverage is primary and which is secondary. While a QHP is not structured to pay secondary benefits, nor are the premiums calculated or adjusted for secondary payment, a person with Medicare will not receive premium assistance or subsidies under federal law. Although federal law makes it illegal for insurance companies to knowingly sell coverage that duplicates Medicare\u2019s coverage when someone is enrolled in it, there is no clarity on the issue if someone already has individual health insurance and then enrolls in Medicare. To understand this complex situation, you may consult someone at your local Medicare branch office, department of health/human services, or whoever administers the Exchanges in your state. Another thing to note is that if your wife opts not to enroll in Part B at this time, she may have to pay a penalty of 10% per 12 month period she was not enrolled when she chooses to enroll before 65. The penalty reverts to 0 when she turns 65 and becomes eligible under normal rules, but it applies every year until then. If she enrolls during normal General Enrollment (Jan-March), she has to pay the penalty if she fails to enroll and later enrolls. However, if the enrollment extends beyond March and is a Special Enrollment Period, she may have the option to enroll next year without a penalty."}

This is commonplace, as seen in the health club model, where regular attendees are supported by those who pay but don't show up. Netflix and MMOs follow a similar principle. Though acquiring new customers can be expensive, businesses often pay a premium to secure them as long-term customers. For example, banks must provide a means of banking for their customers, and ATMs help reduce the expense of staffing multiple branches.

The United States Gasoline Fund (UGA) tracks gasoline, and the United States Heating Oil Fund (UHN) tracks heating oil. It's best to avoid ETFs that have double returns, as they don't track well. It's important to note that an unmanaged single commodity ETF will always lag behind spot prices over time, and the ETF issuer's claims aside, these products will likely fail over time. This issue doesn't occur with gold, as the ETF (GLD) simply buys gold, which cannot be replicated for oil."}
{"1681": "\n\nThere is currently no evidence to suggest that the recent decline in the global stock market will affect the UK housing market. The recent drop in the stock markets is largely attributed to two factors: the Chinese government's decision to devalue the Yuan and subsequent panic by investors and speculators. However, these factors do not directly or indirectly influence the housing market in the UK. The most influential factors affecting house prices are supply and demand, buyer sentiment, and interest rates, among others. Therefore, if you are considering buying a home in your area, it is necessary to consider these factors. Currently, with a low interest rate policy being maintained by many central banks, it is a good time to take out a mortgage. The value of a company on the stock market is not a significant factor in determining interest rates, as the main directive of a central bank is to maintain regular inflation rates. Finally, it is essential to note that any stock market crashes are typically short-lived, and the underlying reasons behind them may cause problems if they persist."}
{"1682": "\n\nThe effective rate of your mortgage depends on your tax rate. To calculate it, multiply your marginal tax rate (including state taxes, if applicable) by the deduction percentage of 3.1%. Subtract that amount from 3.1% to determine your effective rate on the mortgage. For instance, if you're in the 28% tax bracket without state tax impacts, your effective rate on the mortgage is 2.232%. This assumes you're still itemizing deductions without the mortgage; otherwise, the effective deduction is lower. While others have provided behavioral reasons for prioritizing car payments, this is the financially prudent approach. Additionally, this rate serves as your risk-free rate for additional investments after accounting for taxes on investments."}
{"1683": "\n\nAre you curious about how to build or improve your credit score? To achieve a higher score, it's best to use your credit card and pay off the bill entirely every month. Credit utilization, however, can affect your score. It's calculated based on how often your bank reports your balances to the credit reporting agencies - which can be daily or at the end of a statement cycle. Correct utilization is necessary for active use of your credit. To avoid being reported as inactive/unused, make sure to pay a few active charges and leave some balance by paying at least the minimum amount. Try to maintain credit utilization below 7% for optimal scores. Always remember, on-time payment is the most vital factor, followed by how much you owe and the length of your credit history. Keeping these factors in sound standing will significantly improve your credit score."}
{"1684": "\n\nYou can claim business deductions even if your business has not generated any income, but choosing the right structure for your business is important. There are two options: a Company structure or a Sole Trader or Partnership structure. If you choose a Company structure, you would be able to claim deductions but not income, resulting in a loss. These losses can be carried forward to offset future profits. For more information, refer to the ATO website on Company tax losses. If you choose to be a Sole Trader or Partnership, any business losses you incur may be offset against your income from other sources, such as wages, but only if you pass certain tests. If you do not pass the tests, you must carry forward your losses until an income year in which you do. It is important to note that making at least $20,000 in sales income is the easiest test to pass to use business losses against other income.

Double-entry bookkeeping is an accounting system where every entry made to an account must correspond with a corresponding and opposite entry in a separate account. Essentially, everything is considered an account, requiring the creation of various expense accounts such as \"office supplies\" even if it does not exist as a bank account. In the event of an imbalanced transfer, where only one account is specified instead of both, the imbalance \"account\" can be used to work through each transaction and ensure that it is appropriately tied to its corresponding account.

{"1693": "\n\nRevised: Automatic exercises can pose a high level of risk, particularly when options are closer to the money. In the event of negative equity, a responsible broker will forcibly close all positions and pursue the account owner for any outstanding debt. However, the automatic exercise of near the money options indicates a risky solvency policy. To manage any resulting negative equity or liability, the safest approach is to sell enough underlying assets to cover the loan, closing all other positions if necessary. If the loan remains unsatisfied, additional funding will be necessary to fully repay the debt. As the price of the underlying asset may continue to shift, it is advisable to fund the account as soon as possible. \n\nFor deep in the money exercised options, calls turn into a long underlying on margin, while puts become a short underlying. The decision to close or retain the position should be based on the investor's risk and position selection policies. If the position is unattractive, extinguishment of the liability can be accomplished by closing out the exposure to the underlying asset. Since cash is not marginable, the cash received from position closure should suffice to repay any margin debt. If the position is still appealing, liability management within appropriate margin limits can be pursued. In the case of margin accounts, same-day closing of underlying positions will be considered a day trade, while closings after the exercise will not incur penalties or restrictions. \n\nWhile some brokers allow cash options accounts, many require upgrading to a margin account. In a cash account, equities are not marginable and any debt will trigger a margin call. If a margin debt does not result in a margin call, the account is likely not a cash account since margin for any security, except for certain options trades, is at 100%. During a call exercise, the exercisor or exercisor's broker will pay cash for underlying assets at the exercise price. Any remaining deficit is financed with debt, and underlying assets can be sold to satisfy this debt or sold for cash. While shorting the underlying assets is a potential preemptive strategy, its cost may be prohibitive, and few brokers may allow shorting against the box due to its potential for tax fraud. \n\nIn conclusion, closing out options positions is typically safer and less expensive than taking delivery of the underlying assets."}

During my time working for banks, I was required to report any suspicious activity to my superiors. This involved completing a form that included the customer's name, social security number, account number(s), and identification. Contrary to what might be reported in the media, the threshold for suspicious activity can be lower than $10,000 or even $5,000, depending on how the institution defines it. In annual training courses, we were taught that terrorists and criminals often use cash, despite whether we believed it or not. It's important to realize that many people prefer cash-only budgets to avoid overdraft fees or the higher costs associated with card usage at certain merchants who offer discounts for cash. If someone chooses to use cash for a $10,000 monthly budget, that's their prerogative. Additionally, it's not anyone's business to know what others do with their private property. This has created a distinct contrast in views between older Americans, who tend to see the banking system as overreaching, and younger Americans, who don't seem to care as much. In fact, it was partly due to my discomfort with this reporting requirement that I eventually left the banking system. It's unfortunate that it's become so normalized.

{"1695": "\n\nInsurance in India is provided by both public and private companies, such as ICICI, Maxbupa, SBI, and many others. As the insurance sector requires long-term stability, not just anyone can open an insurance company due to certain capital requirements. The shareholding pattern in the past mandated Indian companies to hold a majority share, with foreign companies limited to only 26% ownership. However, this limit has recently been raised to 49%, allowing foreign companies to invest more capital while still maintaining Indian control over private insurance companies. While the outcome of this economic policy decision will only become clear in about a decade, there are both pros and cons to this new policy. On the positive side, more funds will be brought into the insurance segment, which will strengthen companies, and better global practices on risk and data modelling may reduce premiums for many. Additionally, this will enable innovation in product offerings, and bring more foreign exchange into the country. On the negative side, global companies may increase premiums to maximize profits, create complex products which are difficult for the average person to understand, and withdraw their investment at any time as they are primarily here for a profit motive. As of now, only government companies offer pension schemes in India. Recently, moves have been made to allow private companies to provide pensions as well.

To achieve this goal, it is suggested that a person save enough for their retirement resources to equal the amount they require to retire comfortably when they choose to do so. If you plan to retire at an earlier age, say 40, you may need to save a considerable amount each year. On the other hand, if you plan to retire at 70, you may need to save less each year. Those with a pension or Social Security benefits may need to save less than those without. While retirement funds may provide financial independence, it ultimately depends on one's personal goals.

However, compared to the S&P and other tech companies, AAPL appears to be more volatile. To confirm this, I plan to develop a list of the most volatile stocks I track on Yahoo. Using Excel, I was able to easily conduct this analysis for AAPL, which I found to be an engaging exercise. Nonetheless, it's important to note that stock returns do not always follow a bell curve and that the standard deviation is only an approximation. Given more time, I would be interested in investigating whether AAPL's volatility has changed over time or if the perception of increased volatility is due to its high price. It's also important to keep in mind that a $20 fluctuation for a $600 stock is equivalent to a $2 fluctuation for a $60 stock, even though the former seems more significant."}

{"1701": "\n\nTo get personalized advice on your plans, we suggest speaking with a banker. One factor that contributed to the housing crash was the 80/20 loan, where a buyer would receive a first mortgage for 80% of the home's value and a HELOC for the remaining 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance. This type of loan was popular because it allowed buyers who couldn't afford PMI and didn't have a down payment to purchase a home, but it was risky as they were cutting things too close. While your situation seems different, as you plan to increase your home's value through improvements, it's important to note that sizable upgrades don't always have a 100% ROI. If you're seeking financing, it's likely that the bank will expect you to invest some funds, particularly if your planned upgrades have a lower ROI. For example, if you're considering a pool, a wise banker might suggest you contribute 60% of the cost, as pools usually have a 40% ROI. That said, you might still be able to find a banker who would loan you 100%. As we don't know many details about your particular situation, it's challenging to offer nuanced advice, particularly as certain decisions which look lucrative on paper may be fraught with risk."}

Does it refer to the total cost of animations created by the company in a year, or the cost of plant, so for a \"TV commercial production company\" meaning purchasing desks, drawing pads, Porsches and more? Your example of a \"film or TV-commercial production company\" is not an accurate representation of a business that relies on capital and returns on capital.

However, if the broker fails to transfer your shares to another broker before ceasing operation, getting your assets back can be challenging. \n\nTo illustrate this, let us suppose you took your shoes to a shoe repair shop, but the shop went bankrupt before you could pick them up. Despite the shop's bankruptcy, the shoes still belong to you. If the shop owner were kind enough, they would notify you to pick up your shoes before shutting down. However, if the owner did not give you a notice, it would be necessary to go through legal actions to retrieve your shoes.

Look back over your statements from the past few months and categorize each line accordingly. Take the sum of each category per month and calculate the monthly average.

Neither business should have explicit representation of the other's bank accounts. Each payment should be classified as originating/given to another account, and to ensure accuracy, it is necessary to understand the reason for the money transfer and how the books are set up. Money transferred from personal accounts to the business is likely owner's equity, unless there are other circumstances. For example, in an S Corp, paying oneself a salary is necessary.

I started selling some items on eBay and forums between January and September of 2016, and later established my LLC in October. For items not recorded under my LLC, a 100% gain must be reported as no business expenses or costs can be proven. Overall, this is a question of income tax and not the value of the assets themselves.

In the case of \"double entry\" bookkeeping software like Quicken or GnuCash, credit card transactions are typically managed through a liability account. It's important to note that I'm not an accountant and there may be errors in my terminology.\n\nYour credit card is considered a liability and is tracked in a liability account rather than an asset account like your bank accounts or cash. Essentially, a liability account functions similarly to an asset account, except for the fact that it is subtracted from (instead of added to) your overall assets. When you make a purchase using your credit card, the transaction recorded involves transferring the money from the liability account (increasing the liability) to the expense account that corresponds with your classification of the expense.\n\nOn the other hand, when you make a payment toward your credit card balance, the transaction recorded involves transferring the money from your checking account (or another account) to your credit card account, which reduces the liability. Regardless of which software you choose to track your finances, I strongly advise selecting a software that is powerful enough to represent this transfer of funds between accounts. Simply increasing or decreasing asset accounts is not sufficient when managing credit card transactions."}

Forming a habit of regularly depositing money into your savings account will have a greater impact on your financial situation than obsessing over the interest rates of different accounts. Furthermore, it's important to note that neither savings accounts nor high-yield accounts currently offer interest rates that outpace inflation (which is currently over 3%).

However, if the buyer and I use different brokers, we will need to discuss the transaction details. Regarding citizenship, assuming you are in the US or the transaction is taking place in the US, citizenship status doesn't matter. What matters is tax residency status. This type of transfer is considered a gift, and if I am a US tax resident, I will need to consider gift tax consequences due to the discount value. For instance, if I sold 100 shares of AAPL for $1 each and the fair market value was actually $501 per share, the buyer would effectively receive $50,100 worth of value for just $100, resulting in a $50,000 gift. As this amount exceeds the $14,000 annual exemption, I will need to deal with gift tax and file a gift tax return. Additionally, there will be capital gains tax consequences for both seller and buyer.

{"1734": "\n\nYou mentioned that your strategy was to invest in an index fund, but then you asked about setting stock limits, which has left me a bit confused. Typically, funds are traded at their end-of-day price, so timing the market shouldn't be a concern. Just place your order, especially with Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), as there is a substantial market volume that your trade won't significantly impact the price. In this case, you should place a market order, which is when you buy or sell stocks at the current market price. Conversely, a limit order is when you purchase or sell shares at a specific price. With any US broker, you can either select a limit order or market order. A market order simply fulfills your request with the best sellers available. For instance, if you place an order for 100 shares, sellers offering 100 shares at the lowest price will be matched with your order. If you're purchasing a volatile stock with a small amount of shares, a market order may be best as you'll receive the best price available. However, if you select a limit order, your order will only be fulfilled if the seller's price is the same or lower than what you specified. This doesn't guarantee fulfillment if the stock's price moves away from your limit price. Therefore, if you genuinely want to own the stock, a limit order may not be the best option. The only time you should select a limit order is when you are stating a specific price or a better offer to your broker.

After three years, the value would be 1.331 (y0 * (1 + 0.1)^3). Depreciating by 10% (as a demonstration) brings the value back to y0. Appreciating and depreciating by 10% would cancel each other out. However, if we appreciate by 10% interest and depreciate by 3% inflation, the value would be y0 * (1 + 0.1)^3 * (1 + 0.03)^-3 = 1.21805. For a period of 50 years, the result would be y0 * (1 + 0.1)^50 * (1 + 0.03)^-50 = 26.7777. Note that subtraction can also be used, but inflation should not be ignored. This is known as the Fisher equation. Additionally, inflation should be considered as it has a significant impact on returns. For instance, in a chart comparing two funds, one with a 6% return and the other with a return varying from 3% to 6%, over a period with an inflation rate of 3%, it is evident that accounting for inflation significantly enhances the relative performance."}
{"1742": "\n\nPayday loan companies are essentially like banks, although they differ greatly in their practices. Banks generate revenue in two ways: (1) by charging fees for their services, such as account fees; and (2) by earning interest rate differentials. Banks borrow money from individuals and corporations, using personal savings accounts, for instance, for a small interest rate and then loan that money to others at a higher rate. For example, you might earn 0.5% on your savings account, but the bank will lend the same money to someone else at 2.5% as part of their mortgage. \n\nOn the other hand, payday loan companies earn revenue by charging a substantial markup on loans given to their customers. These rates of interest can be so high that in countries without proper regulation, annualized interest rates of greater than 1000% are not uncommon. Thus, it hardly matters whether payday loan companies obtain money from investors who bought shares in the company, other traditional banks who lend money as they would to any other business at a standard interest rate, or from various other sources. They may even raise funds publicly by issuing bonds for the company as they offer such high rates of return on the money lent out that where the money came from is not very relevant."}

While it's true that you'll be guaranteed the interest rate listed on your mortgage agreement as long as you make your first draw before the rate hold expiry date (which is typically 120 days after you apply), there is a potential downside. Building a home from the ground up often takes at least six months or longer. This means that you're taking a risk on what interest rates and qualifying criteria will be down the road. With a 'Completion Mortgage,' you can only lock in your interest rate 120 days before you take possession. Because lenders are constantly changing their guidelines and rates are expected to spike over the next few months, your best bet might be to opt for draw mortgage financing. That way, you can rest easy knowing that your financing is in place well before construction begins. This peace of mind is incredibly valuable and allows you to focus on preparing for your move. The only potential downside to draw mortgage financing is that if interest rates fall in six months or a year, you might lose out on the opportunity to lock in a lower rate."}

{"1746": "\n\nThe important question to ask when contributing to a 401(k) is, \"Why am I doing this?\" Many people invest in order to build a large nest egg and save for future retirement expenses. Investing involves balancing risk and potential reward, and the types of assets chosen for the 401(k) will reflect the investor's risk tolerance. According to a US News & World Report article, diversification is key to successful investing. Investors who limit their investments to a narrow range of assets run a greater risk of loss. Investing heavily in your employer's stock is not recommended, as this can expose investors to significant risk. Investing heavily in any single asset can lead to being under-diversified, which can be risky. Investing in a variety of assets helps investors spread their risk among different types of investments. When choosing investment assets for a portfolio, it's crucial to consider personal risk tolerance and investment goals. It's also wise to keep the portfolio simple and to choose assets with growth potential. Bond and income/money market funds typically offer lower growth potential, while target date funds may include additional fee overheads.

This means that you and your wife can walk to get groceries and other necessities. If it will take you 5 years to pay off your loans even without a car, have you considered how long it will take if you were to purchase one? Additionally, have you considered if you would be able to afford the car payments? Keep in mind that purchases, outside of necessities, have a cost/reward to consider. If you do decide to purchase a car, consider if the pleasure it brings to your life is worth the total cost. Living in a city with excellent public transportation can save you a considerable amount of money on the expenses a car brings. For example, my mom lives in a city and never drives out of it. Despite having low mileage on her car, she spends roughly $3,000 a year on insurance, maintenance, and gas. She only drives to the grocery store once a week - only .3 miles away - and to a mall 6 miles away once a month or less. She can also walk or have her groceries delivered for free. In the end, she spends $250 a month for the feeling of freedom. I understand that feeling but when I am her age, I will gladly pay a car service $20 to drive me around. \n\nAs you are young and managing family finances with your wife, it is important to have a conversation together to determine if the benefits outweigh the costs.

{"1750": "\n\nFirstly, it's important to clarify that the examples given are not specific bond prices, but rather \"generic\" bond price data, representing an idealized bond with a particular maturity period. To view actual individual bond prices, one can visit the UK Debt Management Office website. However, the attributes of price, yield, and coupon still apply to such individual bonds, even if they may not be available for market trade. \n\nTo provide an example of an actual UK Gilt, let's consider the \"4.25% Treasury Gilt 2019\". The UK Debt Management Office currently lists this bond as having a maturity date of 07-Mar-2019 and a price of GBP 116.27. This means that to purchase a bond with a nominal value of GBP 100.00, one would need to pay GBP 116.27. The \"nominal price\" represents the price that HM Treasury will buy back the bond on the maturity date. \n\nIt's worth noting that the title of the bond indicates a \"nominal\" yield of 4.25%, which is known as the coupon rate. This means that the treasury will pay GBP 4.25 annually per GBP 100.00 bond. However, since the market price of the bond is currently GBP 116.27, the effective yield is less than the nominal yield. In fact, the yield can be calculated to be 3.656%, or 4.25/116.27. \n\nIt's important to keep in mind that the yield is not the only factor to consider when investing in bonds. As the maturity date approaches, the market price of the bond will approach its nominal price of 100, which can result in a capital loss for the investor. If the bond is held until maturity, the investor will lose GBP 16.27 for each nominal GBP 100 bond held. This loss needs to be considered in addition to the interest received to determine the gross redemption yield, which in this case is approximately 0.75% per annum. \n\nLastly, it's worth mentioning that there are errors in the pricing of the 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month generics in the data table provided."}

For instance, let's say the company issues 100 more shares to be sold to venture capitalists, causing the total number of shares to increase from 500 to 600. In this scenario, you still own 10 shares, but your ownership percentage decreases to 1.66%.

However, the increased capital infusion can foster growth, and your 10 shares may appreciate in value depending on the company's valuation."}
{"1754": "\n\nWhile attempting to buy and sell stocks for a quick profit may seem attractive, it is risky and expensive. Let's consider a simplified scenario: buying and selling 1000 shares of ABC at $1.00 and $1.01, respectively, may appear to result in a $10 profit, yet you must factor in brokerage trade commissions, typically charged per transaction. For instance, Fidelity will charge $4.95 per trade on both buying and selling, so the 1000 shares would cost $1004.95, and after a subsequent sale, you would only receive $1.10 in net profit. Additionally, the entire investment is susceptible to losing money if the stock declines or leads to eventual bankruptcy. \n\nFurthermore, this approach requires a stock that is both volatile and stable simultaneously. You need volatility to ensure stock prices swing between the buying and selling thresholds, but stability to ensure the stock doesn't shift dramatically away from these thresholds. If this stability-volatility balance is not present, you're better off holding onto the stock for longer, as you'll have the potential for greater profits. \n\nAnother approach is to only trade each stock once by looking for potentially profitable stocks that have been steadily climbing in value. However, this approach involves the risk of buying stocks at their peak prices, which could lead to long waiting periods before being able to cash out, if ever. Furthermore, frequent traders face additional brokerage complexities, rendering it not worth the hassle."}

This would then carry over to line 57 of the 1040 form, after all deductions, exemptions and adjustments to income, meaning that such deductions would not impact this tax liability. \n\nFurthermore, half of this self-employment tax can be deducted on line 27, provided that one has enough taxable income. However, regardless of the circumstance, the individual would be taxed at least 50% of the self-employment tax in addition to their regular income tax. \n\nIt may be possible for the husband to deduct this payment as a business expense on Schedule C, however, if the business is experiencing a loss, there may not be any benefit to be seen in the current year. \n\nIf the individual decides to include this payment as income, it would be considered FICA income and would contribute to their Social Security account. Additionally, it may be worthwhile to investigate whether the IRS has specific criteria established in determining if spousal payments are legitimate or if they are simply used to game the tax system. \n\nFinally, it is possible for the husband to apply any losses incurred in the current year to future years when/if he has net business income.

Firstly, as AbraCadaver mentioned, it's important to have an emergency fund before investing your $30k, in case you experience a job loss or market crash. Also, as JoeTaxpayer suggested, your maxed out 401k may already be invested in stocks. If it's not, you should consider investing in them. It's also important to remember that advisory fees can hinder your investments, and with only $30k, it's unlikely that advisers can save you more than they cost. Additionally, unlike lawyers or doctors, financial advisers don't have a legal obligation to act in your best interest.\n\nWhen investing, it's essential to keep several factors in mind. To begin with, I recommend investing in index funds, which cost less and diversify your investment. Target date funds, such as the Vanguard Target Retirement 2045 fund, are also a good option if you're saving for retirement. Lastly, many companies allow you to invest online without consulting an adviser. Do your research to find a reliable platform, such as Vanguard, which offers a broad range of no-load index funds with low expense ratios. As a cooperative owned by those who invest in their funds, Vanguard doesn't prioritize profits over your needs.\n\nI hope this helps! Feel free to continue posting questions."}

{"1764": "\n\nYou will need to withdraw cash from your Credit Card account and utilize it for trading since brokerage companies are unlikely to accept credit cards as collateral. This is due to the fact that credit cards are unsecured credit, making it risky to conduct trades without any collateral."}
{"1765": "\n\nFor investment purposes, it's more advantageous to consider Country ratings provided by various agencies rather than the Human Development Index or Ease of Doing Business. These assessments would provide valuable insights on how viable a country is for investment in general. For instance, while China may score low in the Human Development Index, it's currently a booming market for investment. Once you've decided on potential countries, you could either invest in funds that specialize in those areas or, if legally permitted, invest directly into the leading stock index of the selected country. If starting a business is the goal, then other indices should be studied. Resources like http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?assetID=1245219962821, http://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/sector/Sector.faces?selectedTab=Overview&Ne=4293330737%2b11&N=0, and http://v3.moodys.com/Pages/default.aspx are great places to gain insights."}
{"1766": "\n\nTo make this scheme work, it is crucial that those controlling the dilution also control their own salaries. This is because when a corporation sells newly issued equity, the proceeds are owned by the corporation itself. In order for the scammers to profit, they must gain access to these proceeds, which essentially means that the board must be complicit in their scheme. While there are many corporations that engage in this type of behavior, it is important to note that it is not the same as a pump-and-dump scam, where a fraudulent group of investors sells the equity. Corporations are governed by a board of directors, which is elected by shareholders, and while the board has no direct operational control, they do have control over the company's finances. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to remove a bad board member once they have been elected, and they can run roughshod over the company's purse. In this scheme, the board works with the top executive to sell shares, increase salaries for key schemers, and increase board compensation. Shareholders trust that these actions are in the best interest of the company, but in reality, they are lining the pockets of the malicious board and executive."}
{"1767": "\n\nWhile market cap might not be a significant concern, bid/ask spread and liquidity are more critical, and the two are often interconnected. When it comes to ETF funds with low trading volume, spread may be wider, possibly amounting to a few pennies. Nevertheless, this is unlikely to be problematic if you don't trade frequently. Expense ratios may also be slightly higher, which can be a factor to consider. However, paying the commission to invest in a larger ETF may not be worthwhile in the near future."}
{"1768": "\n\nThis is a valid inquiry on inflation. I'd like to point out that inflation is presently negligible, and interest rates are at historic lows. This makes borrowing funds a hassle-free process for any stable enterprise. While changes could transpire in a year, Microsoft or any other corporation might be stashing away cash to increase their leverage in acquiring smaller firms, outdoing competitors, and demonstrating their confidence in their current position. It could also be due to a dearth of investment ideas or awaiting better market conditions before making significant moves. However, the negligible inflation rate coupled with the near-zero interest rate renders inflation a non-issue while assessing the company's prospects."}
{"1769": "\n\nOne way to make money on a potentially moderately decreasing stock price on a dividend-paying stock is through covered call writing. This involves selling a contract to sell shares at a predetermined price within a certain timeframe, earning a premium (i.e. time value) of up to an additional 1%-3% return. Although there is a category on Money.SE about covered call writing, the basic idea is to collect dividends and maximize returns if the stock price stays in the middle. Even if the price doesn't rise enough to trigger the call option, you'll still own the stock and have earned an extra return. Moreover, if the price declines moderately, you may still end up with a net positive."}
{"1770": "\n\nWhen investing in assets denominated in a foreign currency, there is always a currency risk involved. It is not only necessary to consider the volatility of your own currency, but also that of the foreign currency. For example, if you are a Canadian and want to invest $10,000 in US stocks, the current exchange rate of 1.3252 means that it will cost you $13,252. There are two ways to earn a profit from this investment. Firstly, if the value of USDCAD increases, and secondly, if the stocks perform well. It is important to bear in mind that since you currently hold US-denominated assets but have the intention of eventually converting them back to CAD, you are effectively long USDCAD (long USD and short CAD). Therefore, an increase in CAD will adversely affect your investment. It may seem unusual to consider currency trading in this manner, but it presents an opportunity. If you want to neutralize the currency risk in foreign investments, you can execute the opposite currency trade in addition to your original investment. In this particular instance, you would buy $10,000 worth of US stocks and then short USDCAD (long CAD and short USD $10,000). This may not be a financially savvy move, but it's worth considering. Additionally, there are currency-hedged ETFs available that can execute this strategy for you, but most of these are hedged relative to USD and are designed to shield the currency of the target country, not your own."}
{"1771": "\n\nDetermining whether to pay off a debt, particularly a mortgage, is not always a straightforward decision. Essentially, if your investment yields a better return than what the bank is charging you, and it meets your risk criteria, it may be advisable to avoid paying back the debt. For instance, in the UK, mortgage rates are currently quite favourable, usually ranging between 2.5% to 3%. In contrast, you would expect a long-term average property return of approximately 9% to 11% (including 3% to 5% rental yield and the remainder on capital gains). To assess the decision accurately, you must consider the following factors:"}
{"1772": "\n\nConsider investigating whether you can continue to use a credit card instead of switching to a debit card linked to your checking account. Choosing a credit card offers an added layer of protection against fraudulent activity that could wipe out your account. If such an incident does occur, most banks provide assistance in recovering the funds when a debit card is used. However, you may be left without access to your money while the issue is resolved. By comparison, credit cards do not withdraw funds from your account during a dispute. Additionally, I concur with other opinions that consolidating all your funds into a single account can make it difficult to differentiate between everyday spending and emergency funds."}
{"1773": "\n\nRevised: Opting for a short sale may appear to be an extreme and unethical measure. However, it would be advisable to review your mortgage documents or seek assistance from a legal expert to ascertain whether your mortgage is \"assumable.\" If it is, you may be able to persuade the erstwhile owner to take over the mortgage."}
{"1774": "\n\nTo purchase oil at a later date and location, you can buy \"futures\" papers. These papers give you the option to buy or sell a specific amount of oil at a predetermined price and harbor location. You can sell these futures at any time, and your profit or loss depends on the market price fluctuation. For instance, if you bought a future for $50 and the market price rises to $60, your paper's worth will increase by $10. Remember that you must sell your future before it expires, or you'll receive physical oil that may be challenging to use. Some traders don't want physical oil, so that someone else will likely buy it; otherwise, you'll need to ensure that you do. Keep in mind that you could lose more than your initial investment if the market price goes against you. If you purchase a future for $50 and the market price rises above $50, you'll have to procure the oil at the new price, which means buying it at the current rate. Theoretically, you could lose tenfold or a thousand times what you invested, depending on what you trade. This explanation is geared towards beginners and doesn't involve technical terms."}
{"1775": "\n\nRevised: Notes and Bonds are issued at par value (1.0). Their value decreases when interest rates rise, and increases when interest rates drop. As an individual investor, it may not be advisable to purchase individual bonds unless you intend to hold them until maturity. Instead, consider investing in a short-duration bond fund or ETF."}
{"1776": "\n\nWith a 30% down payment and a cosigner, is it possible to be denied a car loan for a $100k vehicle? According to BankRate, the average credit score required for a new car purchase is 714, but interest rates for those with scores in the 601-660 range average at 6.39%. While a borrower's high income may offset a lower credit score, not every bank or dealership follows the same practices. If you are self-employed, some lenders require two years of tax returns to verify your income. Additionally, a cosigner's income affects the loan approval process, while debt to income ratio also plays a crucial role.\n\nDue to unknown information and variable lender policies, there is a chance that you may be denied a car loan. To proceed, explore your options by speaking with different lenders and dealerships to find the best interest rate available. Nonetheless, it is advisable to consider purchasing a less expensive car. Insurance premiums on a $100k vehicle are typically high, given your young age, and regardless of your earning potential, situations can change rapidly. Rather than obtaining a car loan, buying a car with cash allows for future upgrades without incurring interest and car insurance expenses over time."}
{"1777": "\n\nDisclaimer: While I am basing my response on US tax law, I believe that the Australian tax situation would be similar. It is unlikely that the tax authorities would accept your claim that the conference was the sole reason for your trip. If you took a two-week vacation, including a two-day conference, it would appear that you added the conference to claim vacation expenses. However, if you can demonstrate a valid reason for attending the conference, it would then depend on the specifics of Australian law. It is clear that the vacation was not incidental to the trip. Nevertheless, you can always claim the registration fee for the conference as a business expense."}
{"1778": "\n\nThere are three financial institutions involved in this matter: your insurance company's bank, the money center, and your own bank. Despite the fact that the money center did not request your signature, \"normal\" record-keeping still applies to the other two institutions. You can inquire about the records they have on file. Additionally, both the company's bank and your own bank should possess copies of the check."}
{"1779": "\n\nThis example is from the real estate field. Let's say you purchase a house worth $100,000 and pay a 20 percent down payment of $20,000. You borrow the remaining amount of $80,000. In this scenario, your equity or market capitalization is $20,000. However, the total value or enterprise value of the house is $100,000, including the $80,000 mortgage. The enterprise value represents what a buyer would need to pay to own the company or the house \"free and clear\" while accounting for any outstanding debts."}
{"1780": "\n\nThese statements do not necessarily contradict each other. In the first scenario, investors are bearish because they anticipate selling in the future when interested buyers have already made their purchases. This would lead to people willing to sell driving down the price. In the second scenario, the trend is strengthened due to an increase in volume, indicating that the price movement has interested many traders. The trend could either be bullish or bearish. The second scenario can lead to the first scenario since an increase in price coupled with an increase in volume could suggest the strengthening of the positive trend. Consequently, traders who are interested in the price move would buy. However, once all the traders who are willing to enter the market have done so, we enter the first scenario. Investors then realize that interested buyers have already bought, and they become bearish, expecting selling to begin soon."}
{"1781": "\n\nBased on the articles I have read, it seems that IV is determined by analyzing the pricing of options. This process takes into account all available information at the time of analysis. However, when a particular option is traded in unusually high volume at a specific price, it suggests that the trader believes there is information that has not yet been reflected in the current price. By acting on this information, the trader hopes to profit from future events."}
{"1782": "\n\nBased on my experience working at a startup that granted Incentive Stock Options (ISOs), here are some things I wish I had known. Firstly, I early-exercised a portion of my options when the fair market value was close to my strike price to minimize Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which required paying out-of-pocket. Despite looking into services like EquityZen or Equidate, I found that they solely facilitated share sales after obtaining ownership, and did not offer loans for exercising. Furthermore, I stayed at the startup long enough for my vested portion of the ISOs to count as long-term capital gains, but found no success in selling them on EquityZen or Equidate due to their transaction minimums. While initial contact with EquityZen was helpful, the company response later became dismissive towards my small stock request. Equidate was a bit more receptive, but pooling shares with other employees did not eventually happen. Thus, my advice is to identify your company's minimum specifics before committing to any cash payment for liquidity. Eventually, I brought the request back to the company and they helped connect me with an external buyer to complete the transaction. As for employer approval, it is reasonable to assume that a company would allow it as employees who pay to exercise own the shares. It is not in the company's best interest for shares to become illiquid on the secondary market, as it sends a negative signal to investors and future employees."}
{"1783": "\n\nAlthough it may seem tempting to offer financial services for compensation, there are several complicated issues to consider such as taxes, liability, fiduciary responsibility, and licensing. Additionally, if you are seeking advice on whether or not you should offer these services, it might be an indication that you are not qualified to do so. Therefore, it is advisable to let someone else who is qualified to handle these affairs do so instead."}

{"1785": "\n\nRevised: Investing in US Treasury securities is considered the safest option, with short-term investments available through the purchase of T-Bills. T-Bills are bought at a discount, such as a four-week T-Bill that requires $99.98 upfront, and yields a $100 deposit after four weeks, with a $0.02 profit on the loan, which adds up to a compounded interest rate of 0.24% over one year (13 four-week periods). More importantly, the investment guarantees the return of the original $99.98, as the US Government cannot nationalize such funds. Please note: the compounded rate of interest figure was initially incorrect, and has now been fixed."}
{"1786": "\n\nIn reference to the UK, it is important to note that structured deposits should not be confused with structured products. Typically, structured deposits are relatively simple deposit accounts that guarantee the safety of your capital, much like any other deposit account. The primary appeal of structured deposits lies in the potential to earn higher returns than those offered by standard deposit accounts - often double - through indirect exposure to the markets. Additionally, structured deposits can be utilized as part of your annual cash ISA allowance, resulting in potentially tax-free returns. These products are favored by individuals with long-term savings, who are content with storing funds away for three to six years, and are seeking stronger returns than those offered through traditional cash ISAs or savings accounts. It is worth mentioning the primary disadvantage of structured deposits, namely, that you may not receive any additional returns other than your original deposit. However, this poses minimal risk if your savings are currently earning less than 1%. For a comprehensive overview of structured deposits, please visit my article at financialandrew.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/fed-up-with-low-returns-from-cash-isas.html."}
{"1787": "\n\nI believe the accurate statement is that Expedia intends to acquire Orbitz for $12 per share. Although the current market rate is $11, indicating the existence of a seller at that price, one cannot assume that everyone is willing to sell at this price. To obtain a controlling interest, Expedia is improbable to bid $12 a share for only 40% of Orbitz's shares."}
{"1788": "\n\nRevised text: Generally, renting out a basement unit would cost less than leasing a comparable space on an upper floor. It is important to report both the income and expenses associated with the rental property using schedule E as if it were a legal operation. Al Capone's conviction for tax evasion rather than his other illegal ventures serves as a cautionary tale. As long as the rental unit is run as a legitimate business, there should be no issues with the IRS. However, the local building authority may impose financial penalties if they discover any violations."}
{"1789": "\n\nAssuming you are referring to US Savings Bonds, please find below information on maturity dates and redeeming them. For Electronic bonds, you can log in to Treasury Direct and follow the instructions there. The cash amount can be credited to your savings or checking account within one business day from the redemption date. Paper bonds can be cashed at most local financial institutions, so you need to check with banks in your area. Prior to redeeming the paper bonds, it's recommended to check with the financial institution to determine what identification and other documents are required. You will be asked to show your identity when you present the paper bonds. You can do this by having an active account with the financial institution that will pay the bonds for at least six months, or presenting acceptable identification such as a valid driver's license if the redemption value is less than $1,000. If you are not listed as the owner or co-owner of the bond, you'll have to prove that you're entitled to cash in the bond. The Treasury Direct website also provides information on converting bonds, rules regarding using them for education, and how interest is credited."}
{"1790": "\n\nI recommend considering a few different options for borrowing the required funds. Firstly, approaching a trusted friend or family member for an interest-free loan and discussing the repayment schedule can be a good solution. Alternatively, if you have any valuable assets like a house or stocks, you could use them as collateral to secure a $5000 cash loan from a bank. Additionally, you may want to explore peer-to-peer lending sites as another potential avenue for borrowing money from individuals instead of banks."}
{"1791": "\n\nIt looks like we share a preference for the trading method of \"buy low, sell high\". However, it's worth noting that some investors have a different approach, known as \"buy high, sell higher\". This involves seeking out stocks that have recently increased in value, indicating that they are \"in motion\" and likely to continue rising. Some investors prioritize stocks that not only rise but do so quickly. \n\nWhile the \"buy low, sell high\" strategy can be effective, it requires patience as stocks can remain low for extended periods. As such, it's a better fit for investors like us who are willing to wait for the right opportunity to sell."}
{"1792": "\n\nAs Dilip pointed out in the comment section, investing in commodities involves either taking delivery or buying. For instance, let's assume you decide to buy a certain quantity of Soybeans in November, and the contract was established in May. If the price increases above your purchase price by November, you can sell it for a profit. On the other hand, if the November price is lower than the contract price, you can opt to sell it at a loss, or you can arrange for your transportation and store it in a warehouse. Although some companies can let you rent their warehouses, it may quickly become a loss-making proposition. By holding onto the commodities, you can keep them as long as you want, subject to the shelf life of the goods. Purchasing contracts make sense for large wholesalers because they can acquire fixed prices for at least 50% of the stock they need. Similarly, significant farmers and cooperative societies have to enter into selling contracts to shield themselves against price fluctuations."}

{"1794": "\n\nWhile it is true that you are saving to purchase residential property, it's important to also understand the sectoral components of the real estate market. There are also commercial, industrial, and retail properties, each of which may have slightly different returns, yields, and risks. Valuation principles can also vary within each sector. It's worth noting that buying a home, although involving real estate risk, typically isn't considered an investment because it's often governed by emotional factors rather than strict investment criteria."}
{"1795": "\n\nIn addition to the reasons stated in previous responses regarding company-specific annual business cycles and historical factors, there is another crucial factor to consider. Accounting firms typically experience a high influx of work during January, February, and March when companies are closing their calendar-year books and conducting audits. By selecting a different period for the fiscal year-end, companies may benefit from the availability of accounting firms and potentially reduce auditing expenses."}

As a result, you may not have access to the most current prices from other ECNs like NASDAQ or NYSE. Though BATS usually offers up-to-date pricing for highly liquid equities like AAPL, this may not always be the case for less liquid stocks.

{"1798": "\n\nAfter entering bankruptcy, the company changed its stock symbol from AAMR to AAMRQ, indicating to investors that the company is in bankruptcy. According to the SEC, when a company files for bankruptcy, the letter \"Q\" is added to the end of the company's stock ticker symbol. In most cases, when a company emerges from bankruptcy, the existing equity stock is canceled, rendering the old shares worthless. Investors should read the company's proposed plan of reorganization before purchasing stock in a bankrupt company since the risks involve never recovering or the old shares having no value to the new company. Some investors mistakenly purchased shares of Tweeter Home Entertainment, a bankrupt Boston-based consumer electronics chain that filed for bankruptcy in 2007, instead of Twitter, resulting in a surge in Tweeter's shares before trading was halted. Although it is possible for the new company to give value to old investors, this is not common as the old investors are often rendered with no value."}

{"1800": "\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Revenue provides information regarding Massachusetts source income. Firstly, it highlights certain items that do not qualify as Massachusetts gross income, such as non-business related interest, dividends, gains from the sale or exchange of intangibles, and qualified pension income. Secondly, it clarifies that Massachusetts gross income comprises items of income derived within Massachusetts. This includes trade or business, including employment carried on in Massachusetts. It is deemed that a nonresident has a trade or business, including any employment carried on in Massachusetts, under certain conditions. Likewise, a nonresident's presence for business in Massachusetts must meet the Ancillary Activity Test (AAT) and Examples to be considered casual, isolated, and inconsequential. If a nonresident derives income from both Massachusetts and other sources, an apportionment of income is necessary to determine the amount of Massachusetts gross income. \n\nTo determine Massachusetts source income, three common apportionment methods are available, where gross income is multiplied by a specific formula. In conclusion, it is important to note that if a person is purely an employee or contractor and not an owner, they must pay taxes on their Massachusetts income in Massachusetts. This also extends to other sources of income, such as copyrights and real estate. However, if the work is performed outside Massachusetts, one is not required to pay Massachusetts tax on that income. The income's reporting type, whether at 1099 or W-2, does not legally affect the outcome, but it may impact the practical aspect."}
{"1801": "\n\nRevised: If your intention behind using the ESPP is to generate a secure 15% return on part of your income, the following suggestions will be useful. Previously, the advice given to young employees was to prioritize the 401K match over a Roth account. However, with the introduction of Roth 401K accounts, this advice has changed, allowing employees to benefit from both Roth and the maximum match. Therefore, my proposal for your situation is to contribute enough to the 401K to receive the maximum match, while also investing as much as possible in the ESPP. Once you receive the proceeds, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA. However, if you reach the IRA limit, you must decide whether to reduce your ESPP to contribute more to the 401K."}
{"1802": "\n\nIs it true that interest rates increasing will lead to an increase in inflation? This is typically the reverse, as inflation usually causes interest rates to rise. Interest rates represent the willingness of people to spend money in the future rather than the present. If someone lends money for a period of time, they lose the ability to use that money, and need to be offered an incentive in the form of additional money at the end of the period to be enticed to loan it. This additional money is the interest rate. Given the choice between receiving the same amount of money today or in the future, most people would choose the immediate payment, as money in the present is worth more than the same amount of money in the future. Even without currency that can be printed, interest rates would still exist, as people would still prefer to have money today rather than in the future. If a currency is devalued by continued printing, borrowers may charge additional interest to compensate for the loss in purchasing power when they make a loan. It's difficult to compare interest rates and inflation, as inflation is challenging to quantify due to continually changing consumer preferences and the introduction of new products and services."}

{"1807": "\n\nIf you're considering cashing a check from 26 years ago, talking to the bank won't be helpful since it's highly unlikely that any bank would honor such an outdated check. In the U.S., checks often have a validity period of only 180 days, which helps maintain simple accounting for companies and banks. If you plan to pursue cashing the check, you may want to consider reaching out to your late husband's former employer. Explain the situation and ask if they would be willing to research the matter and issue a new check in recognition of your husband's contributions to the company. While they are not legally required to do so, they might do it as a gesture of goodwill. When a company does not receive the cashed check, they usually have to reconcile their accounting records, making certain that they have appropriately categorized the funds. While there is no legal obligation to issue a new check, it's worth exploring the option. If the company maintains a policy on stale-dated checks, they might agree to issue a new check as a goodwill gesture. This inquiry raises intriguing questions, and it would be interesting to see feedback from others. I hope the discussion will continue, and good luck in your pursuit."}

If you have a significant amount of debt, filing for bankruptcy may be an option, but this can have negative consequences for your financial future. Additionally, it is ethically wrong to borrow money without the intention of paying it back. If you have the funds, paying off the entire balance with a high interest rate of 23% would be wise to eliminate one bill to worry about. For example, if you have been making $100 payments on each card, redirect the additional $100 to lower the remaining balance. Even if you have an investment opportunity or a small emergency fund, it's still worthwhile to focus on reducing debt with high interest rates. Savings accounts with modest interest rates do not outweigh the cost of high-interest debt. If possible, consider opening a zero-interest credit card and transferring the balance. Although there may be a fee, it could help you avoid accruing more interest while working on paying off the balance. Additionally, you may receive cash back from the transfer."}

{"1818": "\n\nWhen you sell a stock that you own, you will either realize gains or losses based on the difference between the buying and selling prices. If the gains are realized within a year from the date of purchase, they are treated as short-term gains and are taxed at your marginal tax rate, whereas if they are realized after a year, they are considered long-term gains and are taxed at a lower, preferential rate. It is essential to take into account the losses, as they can offset gains, thereby reducing your tax liability, and they can also be carried forward to the next tax year. \n\nIn situations where you own multiple shares of the same stock bought at various times and prices, you have the flexibility to choose which shares to sell - this approach is referred to as lot matching or order matching. It is advisable to sell the shares that have lost value before those that have gained value to book the losses and decrease the tax liability. Conversely, selling the shares that have increased in value would result in increased taxes. \n\nIf faced with the option of booking short-term or long-term losses, it is better to opt for the former since short-term gains tax is higher than long-term gains tax. Also, when selling remaining shares at a profit, it is best to sell the ones purchased earliest as long-term gains attract lower taxes, thus converting your short-term gains into long-term ones. There is a simple formula to calculate tax paid: (profit - loss) x (tax bracket)."}

{"1820": "\n\nThis depends on how you choose to assess your performance. Here are a few simple examples to start. Let me know if you require more information. If you strive to achieve maximum financial return, then you should always use maximum margin, provided your expected return (%) is higher than your borrowing cost. For instance, if you can double your investment using margin, and the cost to borrow is 7%, and you're investing in a security that expects to return 10%, then your annual return on an account opened with $100 will be: (2 * $100 * 10% - $100 * 7%) / $100 = 13%. Hence, your expected return, amount of leverage, and cost to borrow will all determine your return. \n\nAdditionally, if you want to consider the additional risk, you're taking, you can use the Sharpe Ratio. For instance, suppose the same security has 20% volatility, and the risk-free rate is 5%. In that case, the Sharpe Ratio without leverage is: (10% - 5%) / 20% = 0.25. The Sharpe Ratio using maximum margin, however, is: (13% - 5%) / (2 * 20%) = 0.2 where the 13% comes from the above formula. Therefore, on a risk-adjusted basis, it's better not to utilize margin in this particular example."}

Eventually, I came across a short-term lease that could be switched to a month-to-month arrangement at an equitable rate, as rental properties were scarce. Unfortunately, by the time I found a house, there was stiff competition due to a decrease in supply, which can happen seasonally. Despite bidding wars, appraisers helped to prevent the seller from charging exorbitant prices, and I ultimately secured the property by offering an additional $10k over the asking price. The appraisal later came in $10k lower than my offer, allowing me to purchase the house at a reasonable price. Thankfully, I had done my research and knew what the property was worth. The mortgage cost was the same as my previous lease, and the house came with a 1-year warranty for major repairs. Since moving in three months ago, I've already gained nearly $8k in equity. On top of that, I can expect a $19k tax writeoff, as my salary of $72k will be reduced to taxable income of $53k.

Thankfully, the blog post offers several affordable alternatives and suggests utilizing Vanguard's inexpensive financial planning service if you opt for that platform. Investing advice often neglects to acknowledge the emotional element of financial decision making. Although it would be ideal to rebalance one's portfolio at exact six-month intervals and assume the precise amount of risk for optimal returns, real-life human behavior isn't quite so predictable. We must recognize that the average investor often pulls out of the market when it hits rock bottom and buys when it hits its peak. While we may know what's best, fear, greed, and laziness often get the better of us. Therefore, we shouldn't rely solely on our investment strategy any more than we should rely on our diet and exercise regime. I suggest using a balanced fund rather than a financial advisor, but I acknowledge the potential value in having a trustworthy advisor. It's important to remember that the main risk in investing is oneself. Fear, greed, and laziness are formidable adversaries. We must factor in the human component when making financial decisions.

However, in reality, stock prices tend to shift slightly towards the surprise just before the announcement, and this may be due to illegal information leaks or savvy investors replicating computations to predict the announcement. Option market hedging does not impact stock prices as it involves transferring risk between parties, but it could slightly increase option prices through greater implied volatility.

Depending on the interest rates offered, financing through your bank at the cash price could save you more money compared to the dealer's loan. \n\nA few additional points to consider include being willing to drive further for warranty work, choosing to purchase a one or two-year-old car from a dealership that specializes in used cars, where they may have received the used car as a trade-in."}

A 10-20 percent drop in real estate prices could cause a financial crisis, especially since mortgage rates are currently at 2.5 percent. A mere one to two hundred basis point rise could lead to a nearly 50% drop in real estate prices, assuming interest payments remained constant. Canada would need to significantly boost its economy or experience a sudden collapse of oil prices to encourage the central bank to sharply increase rates.

Exercising early can help you avoid the potential nightmare scenario in which you leave the company and cannot afford to exercise your options due to tax implications. Additionally, exercising early may be less risky in some scenarios. For example, if you work for a privately held company, and you anticipate staying for a while, but not sure when the company will go public or be acquired, exercising early can be wise.

It's not standard practice for banks and credit card companies to monitor public records daily. Instead, the person handling the estate must acquire copies of the death certificate and search through physical records to identify all active accounts. To facilitate this process, it is advisable to organize one's financial records beforehand; there are resources available on this topic. The executor will then communicate with banks and credit card companies to ensure any pending transactions go through and to close or transfer autopayments. They will also notify credit agencies to flag the deceased's accounts to discourage new ones from being created. Multiple copies of the death certificate will be necessary."}

{"1863": "\n\nOptions inherently have leverage, meaning their profit or loss is multiplied. The degree of leverage is determined by the options strike compared to the current share price and the time until expiration. Investing in options is more challenging than stocks because you must accurately predict both the future price movement and timing. Unlike stocks, where an unrealized loss can become a profit over time, profits or losses with options become definite rapidly. As a professional options trader, my best advice for beginners is to purchase significantly in-the-money options for both calls and puts. This approach provides better leverage than buying or selling shares outright, while minimizing the chance of losing the premium. Deeply in-the-money options also reduce a constant loss of value as you wait for the expected move. Options market-makers avoid trading in fairly- to deeply-ITM options because they offer neither large nor easy premiums. By dealing only in ITM options initially, you can avoid being the average novice. Some investors believe that long-expiration options that are not in-the-money could provide similar benefits, but with significant time value that slowly erodes your investment every day, it is not a practical solution. I recommend only dealing in deeply- to fairly-ITM options with expirations of 1-4 months, depending on your desired level of risk."}

{"1866": "\n\nRevised: If I'm not mistaken, tracking a value-weighted index should be easy - you simply buy the shares in the exact amount they appear in the index and wait. However, in practice, it can be difficult. Most funds that track the S&P 500, for example, do it on a sample basis to maintain the fund size. Although I don't know the exact number, one would need close to a billion dollars in fund size to replicate the 500 stocks in the same percentages. Therefore, various strategies are adopted, such as sampling companies or selecting a set of companies that mimic the S&P's behavior. All these strategies may result in tracking errors, but there are algorithms to reduce them. Rebalancing your holdings is necessary only when there's a change in the index, such as a company being dropped or a new one added. Despite this, passive ETFs still require frequent rebalancing, and generally lose to their benchmark index. \n\nFor example, let's take an index with just three companies, and let's say the total market cap is $1,000. The minimum required amount to mimic this index is $200 or multiples of $200. However, most funds can't be this large. Approximately 100 funds track the S&P Index, and together they hold around 8-10% of the market cap. However, few large funds such as Vanguard may hold around 2% while most of the 100+ S&P funds hold something in the 0.1 to 0.5 range. If a fund only has $100 to invest, it has to buy shares in fractions, which may force the fund manager to allocate out of proportion or leave some cash unused. This leads to a tracking error, and the fund may not truly mimic the index. \n\nAfter April 1, if the share price moves, it may cause more or less tracking error if no action is taken. For instance, selling one share of company B and purchasing one share of company C would reduce tracking error. However, this is a simplified view, and tracking error computation is involved mathematics. Therefore, to track the S&P 500, fund managers require frequent rebalancing."}
{"1867": "\n\nI believe there may be some confusion between forward-looking statements and actual results. The objective of the fund is to primarily invest in stocks that offer current dividends, focusing on high-quality companies with potential for long-term growth in earnings and willingness to increase dividends over time. In 1993, several companies paid dividends, resulting in VDIGX being able to distribute dividends. However, the amount distributed in different years varied; for example, in 2000 it gave $1.26, in 1999 it gave $1.71, and in 1998 it gave $1.87.\n\nPresently, economic conditions are such that many companies are not making large profits, and are preferring to hold cash rather than distribute dividends to their shareholders to help them survive the challenging times. It is essential to clarify that the primary objective of this fund is to invest in companies that provide dividends that are passed on to fund holders, without selling appreciated stocks to convert them into dividends."}

The \"current price at which the stock is exchanging hands\" can be better referred to as the \"last trading price\" as the exchange negotiates prices between buyers and sellers through managing bids and asks. Actual negotiations occur between bids and asks, and transactions happen if they intersect. The reason why the bid and ask prices move away from the last price is mostly unknown. For market makers, when their sell inventory is decreasing due to heavy buying, they increase their asks while slightly raising their bids as they aim to remain market neutral, balancing their longs and shorts inventory. They try to accommodate the buying pressure while avoiding losses, so they raise their ask price and bid higher once people hit the ask price. There are typically multiple bids and asks, and once one is hit, the next highest in line becomes the new ask. Market makers are known to step over the highest bid to bid at a slightly lower price to get an 11% return on investment.

{"1873": "\n\nTo expand on this topic, besides speculative investors like hedge funds, companies in the \"real economy\" use forwards (and futures) to secure a particular price in advance or minimize investment risk. According to Investopedia, a currency forward is a binding contract in the foreign exchange market that sets the exchange rate for purchasing or selling currency on a future date. It is a hedging tool that does not require an upfront payment and can be customized based on the amount and delivery period, unlike standardized currency futures. This feature is useful for planning and risk management purposes. For instance, if a company needs to pay $1 million USD in the future, and most of their revenue is in Euros, the amount they need to pay will fluctuate depending on the exchange rate between the two currencies. Therefore, it is beneficial to lock in an exchange rate to determine the exact amount they need to pay relative to their projected revenue. The objective is not necessarily to profit from the transaction but to reduce risk and enhance planning capabilities. Moreover, the fact that a currency forward does not require an upfront payment is an advantage since holding onto cash for a year is not practical. Additionally, savings accounts typically pay less interest than inflation, resulting in a guaranteed loss."}

While a significant number of finance professors and experts question the feasibility of timing markets such as NYSE, NASDAQ, or LSE, numerous hedge funds and money managers actively attempt to disprove the EMH. Personally, I believe that the EMH holds true, and that even for individuals who devote their entire lives to attempting to outperform it, timing a highly efficient market like NYSE remains incredibly difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, for individuals whose primary job does not involve investments, I strongly recommend disregarding the idea of timing the markets altogether."}
{"1875": "\n\nThe chart depicts the net profit or loss an investor may realize based on the settlement price of the underlying asset upon expiry, with the x-axis indicating the underlying asset price and the y-axis representing profit or loss. In the first scenario, the investor sells a \"naked put write\" option with a marked strike price \"A.\" The maximum profit, shown as a horizontal segment extending from above the \"A\" point on the x-axis, is equal to the premium received upon selling the option. If the underlying asset settles at a price lower than the strike price, the net profit will transition to a loss; the slope of the diagonal segment represents the extent of the loss relative to the strike price. At the point where the diagonal intersects the x-axis, the net profit is zero.\n\nIn the second scenario, the investor sells a put option with a strike price of \"B\" and purchases a put option with a lower strike price of \"A.\" The chart follows a similar logic as the first example, but the purchased put option at a lower strike price limits the potential loss should the underlying asset depreciate significantly. The horizontal segments above and below the x-axis represent the maximum profit and maximum loss, respectively. The maximum profit is calculated by subtracting the premium paid for the put option at a lower strike price from the premium received for selling the higher strike price option. The maximum loss, in turn, is limited by the premium paid for the put option at a lower strike price, offsetting losses beyond the strike price \"A.\""}

To initiate a chargeback, your bank will typically require that you first provide the vendor with an opportunity to rectify the situation themselves, rather than simply giving up after a long hold time. If banks allowed customers to initiate chargebacks for any and all customer service disputes, they would be inundated with requests all day long. Therefore, if you want your money back from a vendor like Comcast, you may need to take other steps like visiting in-person during non-peak hours or posting bad reviews online. When speaking with customer service representatives, always be polite and respectful, recognizing that they didn't necessarily cause the problem.

{"1879": "\n\nDollar cost averaging can be employed in a retirement plan or for purchasing individual stocks. This strategy can boost your returns while mitigating your risk, particularly if you are investing in a specific stock for the first time. Numerous times, I have purchased a stock at a low price only to realize that it drops even lower, resulting in a loss of thousands of dollars. In such situations, one can either sell at a lower price, hold on to the stock or invest more money. I now wish I had eased into my investments slowly as this would have resulted in owning more shares at a reduced cost basis. The stock market is volatile, and it is impossible to predict whether stock prices will increase or decline. In the given example, a loss of $3,000 is equal to the cost of about 300 trades, indicating that trading costs should not be a concern. Therefore, one should invest in individual stocks gradually, gradually taking advantage of the market. Another crucial factor to remember is that dollar cost averaging entails purchasing varying numbers of shares with the same amount of money, reducing the total investment cost. For example, if you spend $2000 on a stock trading at $10 (200 shares), and the stock price climbs to $20, you will spend $2000 and acquire 100 shares. If prices drop to $5, you would spend $2000 and buy 400 shares, acquiring a total of 700 shares for $6,000. In contrast, had you bought 200 shares for $2000 at $10 per share, then 200 shares for $4000 at $20 per share and 200 more shares for $1000 at $5 per share, you would have amassed only 600 shares for your $7000 investment, unlike dollar cost averaging."}

{"1881": "\n\nThe phrase \"Sell 200 at 142\" refers to the action of selling 200 units at a price of 142. The units could be gallons or barrels of orange juice, or pounds or tons of frozen juice. It can either mean that the seller has 200 units to sell or that they are borrowing 200 units to sell, which is known as a naked short. In this case, it appears that the seller is selling a futures contract. A futures contract involves promising to obtain orange juice by a future date and sell it at an agreed price. People usually make a profit by buying low and selling high, but in this scenario, the seller first sold the units without a supply and later covered their position by purchasing the supply. They profited because the buying price was lower than the selling price. \n\nThe futures market is a necessary tool for orange juice makers as it allows them to sell orange juice at a rate that they can afford to pay for oranges, which growers can then sell at an agreed price. This way, both the grower and the orange juice maker share risks with each other and financiers. With the help of insurance, this system allows for predictable finances. Without it, growers would have to be wealthy to afford the variation in crop yields and prices."}

{"1885": "\n\nWhen considering Inflation, there are two key factors to keep in mind. Firstly, Inflation is essential to ensure that goods maintain their value. Consider Moore's Law - a mobile phone that costs \u00a3100 today will be valued at \u00a350 in two years. Therefore, it is crucial to balance purchasing power and value to maintain financial stability. For example, if you account for a 2% loss rate, in two years, your \u00a3100 investment will only equate to \u00a396.04 in today's value. However, if you invest in a mobile phone to assist in business operations and generate a profit of \u00a31000 in two years, the initial investment will offset the cost of inflation. \n\nSecondly, Inflation serves as an incentive to encourage spending. If you spend \u00a3100 today, this will generate \u00a3100 of income for someone else who will also be incentivized to spend and stimulate further economic activity.

{"1888": "Revised: Many mortgages include penalties for early payment, and some even disallow it entirely. It's understandable why lenders discourage early pay-off. Generally, when borrowers pay off loans early, it's because they have refinanced to a loan with a lower interest rate, usually during a market downturn. However, if the loan is paid off early, lenders are left with two choices: reinvest the money or risk losing it altogether. Unfortunately, reinvesting the payout during a market downturn could result in losses or lower returns, as the rates are unlikely to be as favorable as those on the original loan."}

{"1894": "\n\nHere's what you need to know: There is a way to prevent property damage by implementing a strategy that a previous renter used with us. It may seem a bit sneaky but it's highly effective. If your property is worth it, consider raising the rent slightly higher. However, in order to justify the increased cost, you must ensure that the home is well-maintained, clean, and everything is in working order. This also means being willing to undertake any necessary repairs.\n\nWhile you don't want the rent to be excessively high, a slightly elevated fee is acceptable given that renters who can afford it are typically more responsible and less likely to cause damage. Another good idea to prevent damage is to establish a fee (as our previous renter did) for any necessary cleaning, painting or repairs to be made when tenants move out. It's also advisable to require professional carpet cleaning at the end of a lease.\n\nOur previous tenant, although strict, had a kind disposition and took all necessary measures to keep the property in immaculate condition. He owned a few high-quality, middle-class properties that were well-maintained. Your property could easily be presented as a similar type of business, given your location.\n\nIn the event that a tenant leaves before the lease has ended, you can charge a one to two-month rental fee to find a replacement. To avoid this, however, it's wise to begin searching for new tenants before the lease has expired.\n\nOverall, setting up and maintaining a property using this approach will take some effort, but it's worth considering as a means to prevent damage and protect your investment in the long run."}

{"1896": "\n\nOver a longer period of time, the situation becomes more complex. Although it may appear haphazard, interest rates did not cause the chaos. Real rates sharply decreased in the mid-70s, then saw a massive increase in the early 80s, followed by a gradual decline spanning multiple decades. This leaves only inflation as a factor. In general, real rates should yield a moderate rate, resulting in nominal rates typically being higher than inflation. However, interest rates tend to remain stable over long periods while inflation is not. Economists refer to this as \"sticky pricing,\" where prices, including interest rates, do not fluctuate much, despite changes in the circumstances around them. \n\nThe story is even more complicated. To win an election in the early 1970s, Nixon increased government spending without raising taxes and funded it through the central bank, leading to inflation. The strategy was unsuccessful, but Nixon was reelected anyway. This set the stage for the hyperinflation of the 1970s, which abruptly ended in the early 1980s, during Reagan's presidency. Interest rates remained the same, so real rates skyrocketed. \n\nToday, the world's growth is almost stagnant, and demand for equity is somewhat above average. However, as corporate income decelerates and the population of developed nations ages, the demand for investment income is rapidly increasing. As demand rises, so does the price, which creates an inverse form of the interest rate for an investor. The best forecast for future demand is up to economists, but the Federal Reserve, which has been dominated by monetarist ideas for over a century, has finally learned that low and stable inflation is beneficial. Nevertheless, what happens if US growth suddenly spikes, and the Federal Reserve must sell their heavily bet-upon long-term assets quickly while interest rates increase?

In my opinion, your first priority should be to pay off your car, as buying a car through a loan could lead to financial difficulties. Alternatively, you could sell your current car and seek something to purchase with cash. Your thoughtful approach and planning towards your finances are truly commendable, and sets you apart from others who may not value it as much. \nI'm curious if you're working on your basement in your free time or when work is slow, as it's a great idea to utilize any opportunities to improve upon one's home. Keep up the good work!"}
{"1903": "\n\nIt appears that your current loan is for a new car while a potential refinanced loan would be for a used car. It's important to note that different underwriting standards apply, and used car loan rates tend to be higher due to the higher risk associated with them. People with better credit typically choose to purchase new cars. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that you won't benefit from refinancing, but you may need to do some research. I recommend taking a step back and considering a few factors. While a 5% reduction in payments may seem significant, five years is a long time, and unexpected events may arise. In my experience, at least one major financial crisis will occur during any five-year period, and at least one substantial challenge will arise during any ten-year period. It's crucial to have savings in place to prepare for these events, otherwise, you may end up having to rely on high-interest rate credit card advances. It's also essential to ensure that your available credit won't be reduced unexpectedly. From personal experience, I prioritize building up savings whenever there is extra income available. While there is no one solution that fits all, it's best to aim for saving at least one or two months' worth of income before considering loan prepayments or other financial decisions."}
{"1904": "\n\nIt is unlikely that the majority of individuals will be required to pay federal gift taxes, which only apply to gifts over 5.34 million dollars throughout one's lifetime, and are annually adjusted for inflation. Connecticut and Minnesota are the only two states that impose state gift taxes; in Connecticut, taxes are due after reaching two million dollars in lifetime gifting, while in Minnesota, taxes start at one million dollars. The responsibility of paying federal taxes usually falls on the gift giver, with an annual exclusion amount of approximately $14,000, allowing for tax-free gifts to multiple recipients. Gifts surpassing this limit require the filing of an IRS Form 709 gift tax return, with taxes only becoming due once exceeding the 5.34 million dollar threshold. An exemption can be claimed if required. Tax payment is rare, as it is unusual for individuals to exceed the lifetime exclusion amount. The annual exclusion amount is adjusted yearly for inflation."}

Unlike in the US, Canada does not differentiate between short-term and long-term gains, as each type of gain is taxed at the same rate. Whether you buy and sell a stock within minutes or hold onto it for years, any profit you make on a stock can generally be considered a capital gain. It is worth noting, however, that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may consider you a professional trader if you frequently buy and sell stocks for a living. In such cases, your gains will be taxed as regular income, but you may also be able to claim additional deductions. Nevertheless, this is unlikely to be an issue as long as your primary source of income does not come from trading. For further information on these subjects, please refer to the following articles:"}

In the case you mentioned, the lower credit score will likely be the deciding factor. However, you may need to use your girlfriend's income to qualify for the loan, despite her poor credit, in order to meet the income requirements. Obtaining a mortgage, like any loan, depends on two factors: your creditworthiness (credit score) and your ability to repay the debt (income and debt-to-income ratio). If you don't have enough income to qualify for the loan or fall short of the debt-to-income ratio, tapping into your girlfriend's income may be necessary.

{"1912": "\n\nI had around $16k in student loans, but unfortunately, I defaulted on them, and they were passed on to a collection agency called Osceola, who I have found to be a legitimate company. When verifying my identity, they asked for my Social Security Number and Birthday Details, which is not sketchy in itself, but generally, this practice is not recommended as it can be used for identity theft. However, Osceola has followed the rules in this regard. My mother suggested bankruptcy, but this is not an option for student loans, as they cannot be discharged through bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThe loan is from a school; therefore, I should consider contacting them for assistance. It is possible that they may have more information or be able to offer some help. Additionally, it would be a good idea to name and shame the school, so future applicants are aware of this issue.\n\nIn dealing with Osceola, I would recommend avoiding negotiations over the phone. They have demonstrated a reluctance to respect such negotiations in the past. Instead, it would be better to ask for written communications, which can be sent through postal mail as proof. Keep copies of all communication, including canceled checks. It is of utmost importance never to ignore a letter from them or skip going to court if summoned, as they can get a default judgment.\n\nIf I want to negotiate with Osceola, I would recommend politely writing them a letter outlining the conversation's details and asking for what I want, including the removal of the $4k fee. It is crucial to include any evidence of payments made during the six months agreed upon. It would also be prudent to send a copy of this letter, marked \"'cc'\" to regulatory authorities, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, and my congressional representative. In the event that I am served with a summons or do not make any progress in negotiations, hiring a lawyer may be necessary.\n\nIt is unfortunate, but bankruptcy is not an option for student loans, so it is vital to exercise caution and protect oneself when dealing with student lenders and their collection agencies. John Oliver's detailed investigation into this industry highlights their dubious practices and predatory nature. Finally, good luck, keep a level head, and stay safe."}

Many companies are traded on Pink Sheets because they failed to comply with SEC regulations, are bankrupt, or do not want to meet the reporting requirements. While purchasing an ADR of a company traded on the LSE may be safer than other securities, it still means that you are buying an unregulated security, even if the company is regulated elsewhere.

First, it is crucial to determine the ratio of debt to equity. The target D/E ratio is 50% (or 0.50). To achieve this, every $0.50 of debt raised, the company aims to acquire $1.00 in equity. This means $1.00 + $0.50 = $1.50. Therefore, the portion of debt is 1/3, leaving 2/3 as equity. As a result, the amount of debt is $8,333,333.33, and equity is $16,666,666.67.\n\nUsing the Weighted Average Cost, the formula is as follows: (1/3) * 0.04 + (2/3) * 0.12 = 0.0933333.\n\nTo calculate the total amount needed for the new project, the formula is $25,000,000 / (1-0.0933333) = $27,573,529.40."}

{"1925": "\n\nUpon analyzing the shares of large companies, I found that their dividends typically ranged from 1-2%, with values such as 0.65% or 1.2%. Comparatively, my savings account rewards me with 4% interest annually. However, it is important to note that while interest increases the numerical value of your bank balance, inflation reduces its true meaning. Currently, inflation in India is at around 6%, which means that my savings account is actually losing value by 2%. In contrast, investing in stable companies can potentially yield real-term income through dividends. Furthermore, investors usually hope that the stock prices of their selected companies will grow over time. Despite this, whether or not such aspirations are realistic remains to be seen. While investing in options can lead to larger profits, it also carries a higher risk of substantial loss. Thus, if someone lacks the knowledge or understanding of the stock market, it would be in their best interest to avoid investing in more complex financial products."}

{"1927": "\n\nIt's important to consider what you would do if you didn't have a call option. If you wanted a position in a particular stock but didn't have call options, you would need to purchase it. However, purchasing shares puts you at risk of losing the entire value of your investment if the company folds or something similar happens. A call option reduces your potential losses by limiting them to the cost of the call. Nonetheless, you lose some potential gains since you had to pay for the call, which includes a premium on buying the underlying share directly. By definition, calls/shorts (and similar options) reduce risk by reducing potential losses and slightly reducing potential gains.\n \nWhen you buy a call, the seller can be seen as hedging the risk of price decreases while also guaranteeing that they have a buyer at a certain price, which helps them to manage cash flow. They may be more concerned about having cash flow at the right time while reducing the cost of the share losing value than losing potential upside if the option is exercised. Shorts work in the opposite direction to calls, and forwards and futures contracts are more focused on managing cash flow. Both parties in any transaction stand to gain certainty by knowing exactly what they will get and at what price.\n\nCertainly, you can use these options for speculation, and many firms or individuals do.

{"1929": "\n\nRevised: Bonds\u2019 value may rise if the demand is high, while offering secure returns if the demand is low. For example, a year ago, Russian bond prices declined by a significant margin, but paid out an 18% yield, making them a wise investment choice. Subsequently, the increased demand has driven up the price, with the yield for early investors remaining constant. However, recent investors have to settle for a lower yield of around 9% with higher prices. Banks hardly ever pay out more as variable interest than short or long-term treasuries, but it is not entirely unheard of. In addition, investing in a variable interest bond is different from one with a fixed term; a 10-year treasury bond at 18% ensures that the investor retains the same return, even if interest rates fall within four years. Consider individuals who invested in 30-year US treasury bonds between 1980 and 1985. If you have a considerable amount of funds, storing them in bonds can be an intelligent option, primarily because it is much less likely for the US treasury to go bankrupt than a bank. However, the likelihood of the latter is best left to individual banks as they may not owe $19 trillion like the US treasury."}

You can consider yourself fortunate to have received a refund of $0.15 this time; if they had refunded your card, the 1% reward on a $150 credit would have gone towards next month's payment instead.

{"1938": "\n\nRevised:\n\nMy question is whether stock mutual funds behave more like treasury bonds or commodities in response to devaluation. Upon considering this, it seems that they should respond like commodities. Assuming I own company shares that are not tied to a currency and the company only holds immune assets, would the real value of my stock ownership decrease? If so, why?\n\nOn December 20, 1994, newly inaugurated President Ernesto Zedillo announced the devaluation of the Mexican peso by 13% to 15%, despite previous promises not to do so. This led investors to be skeptical of policymakers and fear additional devaluations. As a result, they turned to foreign investments and placed higher risk premiums on domestic assets. This led to increased market pressure on Mexican interest rates and the peso, causing foreign investors to withdraw capital from Mexican investments and sell off shares of stock, causing the Mexican Stock Exchange to plummet. The Mexican central bank attempted to discourage capital flight by raising interest rates, but this ultimately hindered economic growth prospects.\n\nThe question is how a currency devaluation could be achieved if the currency is floatable. For example, in the 1930s, the US government devalued the US Dollar against gold, moving the value of one ounce of gold from $20 to $35. However, as the US Dollar is no longer backed by anything, how could it be devalued now outside of intentionally inflating it? This varies depending on the currency. For instance, the Hong Kong Dollar, which is fixed to the US Dollar, could be devalued relative to the Dollar.\n\nRegarding whether the real value of stock ownership decreases, the answer is yes if the ownership is in the devalued currency. However, the value may rise over the long term if investors believe the value of the company will increase relative to the currency devaluation and if they trust the market. It's important to note that past devaluations have caused uncertainty and panics, making a definitive answer difficult. The best approach is to look at historical patterns."}

{"1946": "\n\nfor more information.\n\nRevised:\n\nWhen it comes to obtaining financing for property, financial institutions are interested solely in the borrower's ability to repay the loan over time and do not discriminate based on nationality. However, for long-term debts, lenders will need assurance that the borrower has sufficient means and capability to meet their payment obligations. Legal residents in the US have no disadvantage in securing financing compared to citizens, given similar life circumstances. The lender has a legal obligation to confirm the borrower's identity, ability to repay, and lack of ill intent towards the purchase.\n\nPersons without legal status in the US and who cannot pay for property upfront may face challenges in obtaining financing as they may find it difficult to meet the lender's requirements. A lender is averse to investing in borrowers who pose higher risks of defaulting on the loan. As for your father, his lack of legal status and inability to ensure his capacity to repay loans make it unlikely for him to qualify for a mortgage. The lender stands to lose both the money lent and the property if the borrower defaults.\n\nNevertheless, your father can still purchase property legally, but the risks and costs would significantly rise for him as a borrower. Some sellers may be willing to finance property sales over time, but your father's status could disadvantage him if the seller is dishonest. There may be community coalitions that can provide support in navigating the challenges of property ownership. For more information, please refer to the related articles."}

{"1948": "\n\nIf you earn $10 in salary, $5 in interest on savings, and $10 in dividends, your income is $25, not just $10. With a billion dollars in well-invested assets, you can take out a loan against those assets, as the interest payment on the loan will be smaller than the interest you earn on your assets. This means that your investment will grow faster than your debt, resulting in a net positive gain. However, this strategy is not useful if the value of your asset is not increasing. In such scenarios, it is better to withdraw from the asset and spend it directly because a loan against a static asset will only cause you to spend your asset plus interest charges.\n\nSuppose you have a good rate of return on your investment. In that case, you may continue to take out loans and make loan payments from the loan proceeds, while the value of your original asset pool will continue to grow. However, in the event of a severe downturn in the market, you could potentially be left with substantial debts and insufficient value in your assets to back the debt. Therefore, it is essential to consider these risks before utilizing this strategy. \n\nThe U.S. government has been implementing a similar strategy for a long time, but this is only possible because the dollar has been the world's reserve currency. However, as more countries choose alternative currencies for conducting business, the value of the dollar is becoming weaker into the foreseeable future, making this strategy more challenging.\n\nIf you have savings, you can spend more than you earn, putting you into debt. However, you can then draw down your savings to pay off that debt, resulting in you being out of debt at the end of the month. This strategy cannot continue forever because, eventually, you will run out of savings. Similarly, suppose you have no savings but own assets such as real estate, securities, or other valuable items. In that case, you can spend more than you make, be in debt, but have the potential to liquidate assets to pay off your debt, depending on finding a buyer and negotiating a reasonable price.\n\nSuppose you have stock options with your employer or purchased a call through a broker in the stock market or futures market. In that case, you pay upfront for the right to buy a specific amount of an asset at a fixed price (usually with an expiration date). However, you should only exercise your call if the market value of the asset is higher than your option price. Waiting for the market value to increase may be a better option because if the market value drops below your option price, you will be left with further debts.\n\nTherefore, it is advisable to make minimum payments on low-interest debts while simultaneously making extra payments on high-interest debts up until the highest payment you are capable of affording. Continue paying off the highest-interest debt while shifting the payment amount to extra payments on the next highest-interest debt until all debt has been paid off. Finally, live within your means to avoid finding yourself in debt in the future."}

The goal of this initiative is to encourage long-term investing rather than speculation or short-term trading. The government views the latter as a more hazardous option for everyday investors and wishes to reward those who take a lower-risk, long-term investment approach. However, in my opinion, investing, trading, and speculation can all be risky for individuals who lack financial market education. Therefore, the primary consideration when investing should be the asset itself rather than tax implications."}
{"1950": "\n\nAs the owner of an S-corp, it is easier for you to move money in and out of the company as contributions and distributions rather than making loans. Loans require interest payments, 1099-INT forms, and have tax consequences, whereas distributions are not reported, and taxes are paid on net profits regardless of whether the money was distributed. If you received interest, disregard this response as it may not apply. If no interest was paid, it must be accounted for properly. If the company did not pay interest and did not issue a 1099-INT form, money given to the company can be categorized as a capital contribution. Similarly, money withdrawn from the company can be categorized as a capital distribution, and neither event is taxable nor reported to the IRS. When using QuickBooks, create an Equity account for each shareholder making capital contributions and distributions. Deposit money into the corporate account and use the Capital Contribution equity account. For withdrawing money, write a check and use the Distributions account. At the end of every tax year, close out Contributions and Distributions to Retained Earnings through a general journal entry. For example, debit retained earnings and credit distributions on Dec 31 every year to zero-out the distributions account. Pay yourself a reasonable salary instead of distributing profits to avoid triggering an audit."}

{"1952": "\n\nIt seems as though you may not have thoroughly reviewed your agent's agreement, as it should specify the source of the funds. By signing the agreement, you are allowing your agent to receive payment from the net brokerage fees that the buyer pays to the listing agency. As per United States real estate regulations, \"real estate agents are not allowed to receive direct commissions from consumers\" (source: https://www.thebalance.com/how-do-buyer-s-agents-get-paid-1798872). Thus, the agreement should clearly state where the buyer's agent's compensation will come from. Typically, the listing agency will receive broker fees from the seller and then distribute them to both the seller's and the buyer's agents. This means that both agents must split the fee.\n\nIn the event that the seller refuses to pay the buyer's broker, it is possible for you to opt out of the purchase. However, you would not be the one to cancel the deal. If the seller's own broker doesn't have an unconventional contract, failure to pay fees would cause the transaction on their side to collapse, leading to the entire sale being abandoned. In such a case, you would be free from your own broker's fee."}

However, while investing in a property, you may always attain a better ROI with more leverage provided you can maintain a positive cash flow.

Moreover, a loss of equity in the property, or an upside-down mortgage, will further affect your long-term financial stance.

It is difficult to guarantee a leveraged property investment will always generate a better ROI, as you cannot anticipate all losses."}
{"1954": "\n\nPassive fraud can occur in several areas when there is ambiguity about the nature of an arrangement. For instance, when a citizen purchases a house, the mortgage lender expects to know how the buyer obtained the funds, to assess their creditworthiness and ability to keep up with payments, taxes and maintenance. Withholding this information can mislead the lender into making a favorable decision, which is fraudulent. Similarly, making an arrangement based on trust, love and no expectation of repayment is problematic, because it doesn't account for every possibility, including failure. This uncertainty can corrode the relationship and create discomfort for both parties. Money tends to complicate matters and it is important to plan for all contingencies, agree on outcomes that are fair and achievable, put everything in writing and share it with a neutral third party. Such planning may be difficult, but it can improve the prospects of success. Another area where passive fraud can occur is taxes. Poor definition of the payment may cause confusion about how contributions will be taxed. A well-designed contract, even with the involvement of a tax advisor, can resolve this issue. Avoiding \"rent\" as the defining characteristic of the payment is advisable, as this may disqualify the parties from certain tax deductions."}

Recently, I examined one company's offer and discovered that it was essentially a flat stock purchase on the VEST date. If I was GRANTED a large number of shares at a low cost, say a million shares at $1 each, but only 100 shares were VESTed and valued at $100 on the date of VESTing, then I would have to pay tax on the current market value of the 100 shares. In addition, the company would withhold 25% of the VESTed shares for federal taxes and 10% for state taxes, if I lived in a state with income tax. The withholding rate would not change regardless of my actual tax rate. The capital gains tax, calculated based on the time since the VEST date, would be classified as either short-term or long-term. For instance, if the shares I received went up to $120, I would be required to pay tax on the $20 difference based on how long I had held the shares since the VEST date. However, I do not know if this is a universal practice. Your HR department should be able to clarify some of these questions, although their fallback response may be to seek advice from a tax professional. Best of luck."}

{"1962": "\n\nThe first issue that arises is the absence of an \"as-is\" appraisal. If this was not possible, an explanation should have been provided. An appraisal based on potential improvements would only be relevant if such upgrades were planned and should have been disclosed. It is strange that a mortgage lender would disregard these considerations without any explanation. However, there are some loan products that have strict underwriting guidelines for the quality of the house. Although these guidelines should have been communicated, they may have been buried in small print or left out entirely. The lender's criteria are not necessarily reasonable to an individual's preferences but aim to minimize risk and protect the lender's profits. Although not all criteria are flexible or negotiable, it is crucial to inquire about them upfront.\n\nPaying for extensive house improvements on a property that one does not own is impractical. The suggestion, by the lender, to carry out such works is a red flag, and it may be necessary to approach a different lender at this point. It is recommended that you contact the lender and appraiser directly to obtain concrete reasons for their actions. You can also inquire about using the same appraisal with a different lender, but be prepared to encounter variations in criteria.

{"1963": "\n\nAfter conducting some searches on Google Scholar, it appears that the preferred term used by academics is \"target date fund.\" However, there seems to be divided opinions among scholars on this matter. W. Pfau disagrees with a set of citations presented by Paul Sameulson in 1969 in which he argued that there is no mathematical foundation for age-based risk tolerance. The issue seems to revolve around the present value of future wages and whether they are stable and uncorrelated with the market. Some analyses suggest that optimal lifecycle investment should start at roughly 300 percent of the portfolio in stocks (via borrowing), while others point out that stock allocations as low as 20 percent may be optimal if wages are correlated with stock returns. The theory does not seem to be very helpful, so empirical data may be needed. Robert Shiller conducted a study on lifecycle funds when they were proposed for personal Social Security accounts and found that they performed poorly in historical simulations. Basu and Drew also compared lifecycle strategies with their contrarian counterparts, and the contrarian strategies showed higher average returns at the low 25th percentile of returns. One problem with empirical studies is the isolation of the effect of the glide path from rebalancing. It may be that a simple fixed allocation works just as well, and selling winners and doubling down on losers is the fundamental driver of returns. Schleef and Eisinger compared lifecycle strategy with a number of fixed asset allocation schemes in Monte Carlo simulations and concluded that a 70% equity, 30% long-term corporate bonds allocation does as well as all the lifecycle funds. Finally, Pfau's Monte Carlo simulation runs final portfolio values through a utility function designed to calculate diminishing returns to more money. It seems that the best retirement allocation may be low-cost S&P index funds."}

{"1965": "\n\nInvesting in an S&P500 index fund priced in USD carries only the risk associated with the equities comprising the index, given that both are priced in USD. However, if investing in a fund priced in EUR, it is necessary to hedge against fluctuations in the EUR/USD exchange rate to match the performance of the S&P500, similarly priced in USD, as closely as possible. If the fund simply converted its EUR to USD and invested in an S&P500 index fund priced in USD, exchange rate fluctuations could prevent the EUR-priced fund from matching the USD-priced version. Hedging is necessary due to the additional currency risks involved in securities priced in one currency while investing in another. The fund linked to in the question uses swap contracts to hedge against these risks. While such derivatives do cause additional expenses, they may be necessary to ensure the Euro Hedged Index tracks the S&P500 Index.\n\nThere are various ways through which one can hedge against currency risk, such as the use of over-the-counter currency swaps which allow two parties to agree to swap different quantities of currencies at a given exchange rate thereby fixing an exchange rate for a specific time period.\n\nThe article also clarifies that the EUR/USD exchange rate and the level of the S&P500 index can be related in many scenarios. For example, a rise in economic troubles in Europe may cause the euro to depreciate against the dollar, affecting the S&P500 index as well. However, a rise in the euro's value could increase the profits of US companies doing business in Europe, positively affecting their financial statements and potentially the S&P500 index too.

Those with poor credit ratings often have limited housing options as banks require significant upfront cash and landlords may rely on automated scoring to avoid accusations of discrimination. Instead of selling the property, consider using it to generate additional income, such as through Airbnb or housemate shares, and invest that income back into the property. Furthermore, keep in mind that owning a property on paper does not necessarily mean owning all of it as there is typically a mortgage on the property. Be aware of equity, which is the value of the house minus the mortgage owed. It is important to know how much of the payments made on a house are turning into real equity that belongs to the owner. If sister demands a portion of the revenue from the property, remind her that she already receives half of the equity from the mortgage payments.

I do not advocate for the idea of investment returns exceeding the cost of your mortgage. Instead, I encourage a more cautious approach, such as a well-funded emergency fund. Without any 401(k) matching, I recommend balancing your Roth savings and prepayments. \n\nLast but not least, in reference to another resource titled \"Ideal net worth by age X?,\" it is suggested that you should aim to save nearly one year's salary (90K) for retirement. \n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment, and I will be happy to provide more details."}

It is crucial to establish all the details of the loan, including the interest rate, loan term, periodic payments, amount covered by payments versus balloon payment, and whether there is room for additional principal payments. Ensure that all parties sign and document it before the exchange of money. Consider seeking legal advice before signing any agreement. If the loan amount incurs gift taxes, it is best to create an intra-family loan by charging at least a minimum interest rate and making regular payments to avoid tax consequences. It is advisable to consult a lawyer for drafting the papers. There are online services available that specialize in such arrangements and offer bookkeeping and monthly billing for lenders. If the loan is structured as a borrower's house mortgage, additional forms require completing, and expert writing is necessary to ensure the agreement fulfills legal requirements. These conditions apply only to US borrowers since rules differ everywhere. Although the formal intractability mortgage was not too troublesome-related, your case may differ."}
{"1981": "Wire transfers are typically processed through either the Fedwire system or the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS). To transfer money, you provide a bank with a specific code, such as an international bank account number, which instructs the bank where to route the funds. The bank sends a message to the recipient bank through a system like Fedwire, along with settlement instructions. This process can be complicated, as banks need reciprocal accounts to transfer funds directly, but can also use third-party banks to facilitate the transaction. The Federal Reserve plays a role in the process, as many banks hold accounts with the Fed, allowing it to act as a third-party bank if needed. This process generates small fees for all involved parties and is not exclusively used for large transactions. ACH transfers work differently, with payments being transferred between accounts maintained by individual banks at the Federal Reserve. In a typical ACH transfer, the receiver authorizes a direct deposit from an originator, who then begins the transaction process through a middleman ODFI, submitting an ACH entry to the recipient bank\u2019s RDFI, which credits the receiver's account. The Fed acts as an ACH operator and settles accounts between banks, as the individual banks maintain accounts at the Federal Reserve."}

To manage this, you may want to adjust your withholding on your main job or file quarterly estimated taxes.\n\nIn terms of travel reimbursement, tax exemption rules apply similarly to both W2 and 1099 forms. However, with a 1099, you will also need to list your business expenses for deduction on the corresponding tax schedule.

Disability insurance is designed to cover your income in the event that you are unable to work. Some policies pay out prior to social security, allowing you to receive both sources of income, while others pay out after social security to fill any gaps. Social Security is available to all US citizens and has a disability provision that can be utilized. However, it is wise for individuals with dependents or those in hazardous work environments to consider additional disability insurance.

Thus, the bid/ask prices are irrelevant.\u3000Moreover, discussing how much people bid or ask for an index does not make sense because you cannot buy an index directly.

Let's say there is an offer for a car that costs \"$24,000.00 with zero percent financing over 24 months\" or \"$3,000.00 off for cash.\" To see through the hype, we need to look at what really happens when two people take advantage of each offer. One person pays $21,000.00 in cash and drives away in the new car. The second person agrees to make 24 monthly payments of $1000.00, starting in a month's time, and also takes possession of the same car. Both people received the same benefit, and therefore both payment schemes must have the same value.\n\nWith this in mind, a mortgage program would show that paying off a $21,000.00 loan with 24 monthly payments of $1000.00 requires a monthly interest rate of 1.10%, or an effective annual rate of 14.03%. Therefore, despite the \"zero interest rate\" offer, the financing option is essentially the same as taking out a loan with a 14.03% annual interest rate."}

I personally used this approach when I purchased my house, taking out a larger loan than necessary and keeping the extra money in investments with higher returns than my mortgage interest rate. Luckily, I was able to refinance during the recession and my investment is now performing better than my mortgage's interest rate of under 4%. I considered borrowing more or extending the loan term but decided against it as it exceeded my risk-comfort level.

The standard loan formula for an ordinary annuity, as described by BobbyScon, can be used, but the periodic interest rate needs to be calculated from an effective APR rather than a nominal rate. For more information, refer to the EU and UK's definition of APR, which is only valid for effective APR, as demonstrated in the example of a 2003 BMW 325i with a typical APR of 12.9%, 60 monthly payments of \u00a3167.05. To understand the process, see the section on Calculating the Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity. The payment formula is derived from the sum of the payments, each discounted to their present value. Moving on to the second case, it doesn't make sense unless there is a downpayment. For instance, a 2004 Honda Civic 1.6 i-VTEC SE 5-door Hatchback at \u00a36,999, advertised as \u00a3113.15 per month with 58 monthly payments and an APR of 9.9%, would only total \u00a35,248.75, which is \u00a31,750.25 less than the car's price. Lastly, the first case is only an approximation, as a 2005 Toyota Corolla 1.4 VVTi 5-door hatchback listed at \u00a37,195 with a minimum weekly payment of \u00a338, an APR of 16.1%, and 260 weekly payments for a 60-month period, would suggest an APR of 14.3%."}

On the other hand, if your business had an expense you personally paid for, it would be considered a \u2018contribution of capital\u2019 or a \u2018loan\u2019 from you.

If it came from your personal funds, you must classify it as either a 'contribution of capital' or a 'loan' from you. If the remaining amount was deposited, it would bring the 'loan' account back to zero if you choose that option. You should record future expenses that you personally pay for business through the same method. Because these transactions were not through a dedicated business bank account, you cannot record them in Quickbooks as checks and deposits. Instead, use Journal Entries. Debit your capital/loan account and credit your income account for any received income, and debit the appropriate expense account and credit your distribution/loan account for any expenses. If setting up a loan account, choose either the Current Asset or Current Liability type. The capital contribution and distribution account should be Equity-type accounts. I hope this helps!"}

They may indirectly benefit from the profits earned by brokers through short lending, which may result in lower fees or access to short other stocks at equivalent terms. \n\nRegarding the follow-up question, it is improbable for a broker to lend shares for a short duration multiple times a day due to the lack of market demand. While some day traders may occasionally engage in short selling for short periods, it is not a reliable business model. The transaction costs associated with trading, short sale borrowing, and interest make it challenging to profit from small fluctuations in stock prices. Additionally, most stocks do not fluctuate enough during a single day to cover these costs. As a result, sellers who consistently lose money will eventually stop trading. \n\nIt is important to note that while there are no legal barriers to lending stock multiple times, practical limitations and market forces typically prevent this scenario.

Thus, investing in a stock that steadfastly remains at $100 wouldn't yield any profits.

This allows an equity in the account to be sold and purchased with settled funds. Once the amount required to purchase exceeds the amount of settled funds, no more purchases can be made. Therefore, an equity sold with settled funds can be repurchased immediately with those settled funds, as long as they can fund the purchase.\n\nClosed positions may not be considered as \"long\" or \"short\" as they are an account with only one loan of security, one asset of security, and one cash loan and liability, and any profit or loss is reflected in the excess or deficit equity, hence unexposed to the market, only to the creditworthiness of the clearing and settling chain. On the other hand, only open positions are considered longs or shorts, with longs being securities possession and shorts being liabilities exposed to the market. Unsettled funds are not regarded as longs or shorts and are not encumbered by previous trades. Therefore, only Reg T rules apply to new and current positions.\n\nA cash account cannot purchase with unsettled funds, while a margin account can do so. Thus, a margin account could theoretically perform an infinite number of trades using unsettled funds.

However, consider the following scenario: you buy stock ABC for $10 during a bear market as part of a value buying strategy. After holding it for several years, the stock's value rises to $50, and it consistently shows double digit profit increases. Would you sell it simply because it has increased 400%? It could continue to rise or fall in a market crash.\n\nInstead of selling the stock outright, consider placing a trailing stop order of 20% on the highest price reached by the stock. If the stock falls by less than 20% off its high during a market correction and rebounds, you keep it. However, if ABC falls by more than 20% off its high, you would automatically sell it with your stop loss order. By doing so, you may give 20% back to the market in the event of a crash, but if the stock continues to rise, you will benefit from more upside in the price.\n\nYour emotions should not dictate your trading decisions. For example, if you had purchased AAPL in March 2009 for $100, and sold it in December 2011 when it hit $400, you would have missed out on greater earnings. Instead, consider placing a trailing stop loss of 20% on AAPL, which would have allowed you to stay invested in the stock when it hit its high of $702 in September 2012. You would have finally sold the stock in November 2012 for around $560.\n\nThe main advantage of using stop losses is that it takes your emotions out of trading, especially when it comes to selling stock."}

Although it is rare, mortgage lenders will not finance loans that exceed the appraised value. Generally, agreed-upon prices between sellers and buyers are reasonable, reflecting the market value.

On the other hand, when you invest in a mutual fund or ETF, such as QQQ, the impact of any single stock's drop is minimized by the diversification of the fund's holdings. If Microsoft were to drop by 5%, the QQQs would be less affected. If you prefer the flexibility of placing stop sell orders while investing in mutual funds, it is recommended to trade ETFs instead. Furthermore, when investing in mutual funds, it is wiser to use the term \"invest\" rather than \"trade,\" as each fund family may have different regulations regarding selling positions early, including fees and waiting periods before reinvesting in the same fund."}

Generally, the continuously-compounded model is regarded as ideal because as the compounding period of time-valued money decreases towards zero, and the discount rate remains constant over the examined period, the periodic equation's results converge towards those of the continuously-compounded equation. However, these two assumptions, assuming a constant rate and continuous balance adjustment from interest, are typically incorrect in practical finance. Most financial institutions accrue interest monthly, simplifying bookkeeping and reducing interest paid or owed, and unless prevented by contract, accrue interest based on a variable rate that can change daily or even more frequently based on financial market trends. Calculations are generally based on the \"average daily balance,\" while rates, if variable, depend on the \"average daily rate\" over the previous observed period. The first equation is appropriate if you need a quick calculation of an approximate value based on estimated variables, while the second is more appropriate if you have precise periodic data related to the variables in question.

However, obtaining a loan in India may be a better option, as home loan rates are currently around 10.25% (with SBI offering a rate as low as 10.15%). While this may more tangential to the question at hand, it is widely considered safer to hold USD instead of Indian rupees due to India's current inflation rate, which has caused the rupee's value to steadily decrease over time.\n\nAssuming the personal loan would be used for a home loan, which typically has a loan term of around 10-20 years, it is likely that you would end up saving more on the depreciating rupee than you would pay in interest. It is worth noting that if you're able to obtain a home loan in the United States at around 4%, it could be a worthwhile consideration. However, lenders may be hesitant to provide you with an accurate loan value since they may be unfamiliar with the Indian property market.\n\nRegarding the original question, it is highly unlikely to secure a personal loan in the United States for 75k without any collateral. However, since you have a good credit score, it may be possible to obtain a line of credit for 20-25k as a backup. You can use this money to pay your EMI only when absolutely necessary, which will allow you to build your credit in the United States and have a backup for around 2 years in India. Additionally, lines of credit typically only charge interest on the amount used, which can make it a more cost-effective option."}

These loans only require a 3.5% down payment, and you can qualify with a credit score as low as 580. However, adding new credit lines may not immediately improve your credit score. Hard inquiries from prospective creditors may temporarily lower your score, and a new credit account may also lower it initially. While your score may improve slightly in a few months if you make all your payments on time, it's important to have an average account age of two years or older for the best effect. Aim for a credit history that includes 7-10 credit lines of different types, such as store cards, installment loans, and credit cards, to showcase your ability to handle diverse credit. Be cautious not to take on too much credit, as it may affect your debt-to-income ratio and hinder your chances of mortgage financing. I recommend checking out sites that offer free credit scores for advice and tips, as well as credit score simulators that demonstrate how adding new credit cards or paying off existing ones may affect your score.

As you may recall, the banking system was on the verge of collapse due to well-documented reasons. During times of crisis, gold is considered a safe haven asset, whether skeptically or not. Once the market concluded the risk of a banking meltdown had subsided, gold prices began to decline in 2011. Prior to 2006, gold prices had remained stagnant or experienced a downturn since there was minimal interest in gold buying, and central banks worldwide had removed gold reserves from their holdings. Presently, gold is viewed as an outlying asset in contemporary economies, lacking a significant role. The financial crisis may have momentarily affected the perception of gold's place, but it is now returning to its historical downward trend. In future banking crises, gold prices will presumably rise once more, and the extent of the surge depends on the scale of the crisis."}
{"2020": "\n\nRevised:\n\nThe question posed is whether to install sprinklers to take advantage of a 30% discount on a $8200/year commercial insurance policy. The insurance premium is paid in two installments, which appear to be every six months. To simplify the calculations, we will compare the insurance costs to loan repayments made every six months. Without the loan or sprinklers, the insurance cost is $4100 every six months.\n\nUsing the loan payment formula, we can calculate the cost of the discounted insurance, sprinkler maintenance, and loan repayment. With the 30% discount, the total six-month cost comes to $4655.28. To break even with this cost, we would need a discount of 43.5%.\n\nAlternatively, with the 30% discount, we can calculate the break-even six-monthly repayment amount to be $1030. This gives us an equation to determine the required loan amount to break even, which comes to $25989 with the discount.\n\nWe can also keep the loan at $40000 and solve for the break-even loan term, which is 65.5 years based on the given equation. If the loan repayment was monthly, it would slightly decrease the loan cost. The periodic interest rate in our calculations follows the EU and some US methods. These calculations were conducted using Mathematica. \n\nIn summary, with the given discount, installing sprinklers and taking out a loan of $25989 would result in break-even payments, beating the alternative cost of $4100."}

Shareholders can influence a company, but not necessarily in the manner desired. A company is obligated to behave democratically in relation to voting shares, wherein one share equals one vote. This entitles the shareholder to attend AGMs and participate in voting on matters presented by the board. While there may be opportunities to ask questions or make statements, relying on their influence beyond these interactions is unlikely unless the shareholder controls enough shares to sway the board. Convincing other shareholders to vote with you is a viable option to gain that influence. In doing so, it is essential to appeal to their desire for a return on investment. The focus should be on demonstrating how their interests are better served by supporting you rather than the board. Arguments based on morals, ethics, justice, and similar human attributes are not likely to be effective since most shareholders are not individuals, but corporations.

{"2026": "\n\nLet's begin with cash back. Generally, cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable. However, for business use, it is taxable due to various reasons. Most personal purchases are made with after-tax dollars, and the cost of the purchased item is not deducted from personal income. Hence, if you buy something for $100 and receive $2 back from the credit card company, you end up paying $98 for that item, which does not affect your tax bill. In contrast, businesses generally deduct most of their expenses resulting in a reduced deduction. In the above example, if the same item, purchased for $100, was used for business purposes, the deduction would only be $98 for tax purposes, which would require accounting for the $2 cash back amount. However, the $2 should not be considered as revenue but treated as a negative expense similar to a refund. \n\nNow let's address your specific questions. \n\nIn Part 1, you want to attend a seminar for your small business and wish to use credit card reward points to cover airfare, hotel, and rental car expenses. Unfortunately, these expenses are not deductible as they will be counteracted by the refund you receive from using the reward points. \n\nIn Part 2, you asked if it matters if the reward points are accrued on a personal or business credit card. If employees purchase business-related items on their personal credit cards and receive rewards, their employer is not concerned with those rewards as long as the receipts for business expenses are received. Hence, employees must always buy business-related items normally and provide receipts for reimbursement. There seems to be a \"don't ask, don't tell\" rule that the IRS is ok with but do not abuse this loophole. Although travel expenses are expected for business travelers, do not purchase company items on personal credit cards and ask for reimbursement. The company should purchase those items on a company card or negotiate better discounts directly with the supplier. \n\nIn Part 3, you asked if there is a difference between credit card points and brand-loyalty points. There is no difference. Only expenses that you incur, which show up on a bank or credit card statement, are deductible. A payment made through loyalty points is inconsequential. To summarize, the deduction of expenses for taxes in conjunction with credit card reward points or brand-loyalty points depends on what, whether they were personal or business-related items and whether they are displayed on a bank or credit card statement or not."}

{"2032": "\n\nYield refers to the income generated by a bond at a specific point in time. For example, if I purchase a $100 bond with a one-year maturity and a 5% interest rate, the yield would be 5%, meaning I would receive $5 on my $100 investment if I hold the bond to maturity. If I pay $90 for the same bond, the yield would be 17%, as I would receive $15 on my $90 investment. Several factors impact a creditor's willingness to accept a particular yield, but ultimately, the amount of yield offered is the primary determining factor. Creditors generally prefer immediate money to promises of future payment, so they require incentives to lend their money, such as a higher yield rate. Yield curves reflect the relationship between bond yields and loan durations, with the x-axis representing bond time to maturity and the y-axis representing the yield. The yield curve is continually changing as bonds are traded, representing a snapshot of a specific moment in time. Short-term loans typically have lower yields due to reduced market uncertainty, while yield curves may flatten or invert when creditors prefer to keep their money rather than lend it due to sudden market disruptions. However, the US government yield curve should be viewed with caution as one major creditor has the ability to lend the government unlimited funds."}

Instead, I prefer the equal-weight approach when investing in a broad sector such as large-cap companies.

{"2036": "\n\nYour premise is flawed because every investment has the potential to add or reduce risk, depending on how it is used. If your ordering is intended to represent the probability of losing principal, then it is approximately correct, but with exceptions. For example, if you buy a long-term government bond and interest rates rise, its secondary market value may decrease, making it difficult to recover your principal if you need to sell before maturity. Additionally, holding a bond may subject you to inflation-driven value loss, as inflation and interest rates are correlated. \n\nOver a short-term, the stock market can be volatile and result in large paper losses, but over the long-term, it has historically beaten inflation. However, this holds true for a diversified portfolio held for several decades, such as index mutual funds, which can reduce equity risk. Derivatives, when used appropriately, can reduce volatility (and risk) by limiting the upside and downside of your other investments. For example, selling covered calls on equity investments provides an income stream as long as the equity value does not exceed the strike price. On the other hand, selling uncovered calls can expose you to potentially unlimited losses. \n\nIt is not accurate to classify derivatives as a risky class of investments because they can be used to reduce risk. Southwest Airlines, for example, successfully used options to buy fuel at a fixed price in the future, protecting themselves from fuel price increases and beating the competition. However, hedge funds should not be included in this list since they are typically inaccessible to most investors and utilize a range of strategies, many of which are quite risky."}
{"2037": "\n\nHere's the revised text:\n\nWhen it comes to car loans, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, avoid owing too much money on a car that's out of warranty. If the engine blows up and repairs cost more than the car's bluebook value, the entire car loan comes due immediately because the collateral is now worthless. This puts you in an unpleasant situation, as you would have to pay off the car abruptly while also finding other transportation.\n\nSecondly, keep an eye out for early-payment penalties. While they are likely to be cheaper than paying interest, it's important to run the numbers. These penalties are designed to reimburse the lender for the commission or kickback they gave to the dealer for referring the loan. Having an open loan is all you need for positive effects on your credit report; owing more money doesn't help, it hurts. However, since interest is proportional to the principal owed, paying off most of the loan early can suffice.\n\nAs the car nears payoff, you can decrease your costs further \u2013 assuming you can handle the hit \u2013 by increasing the deductible on your collision and comprehensive (fire and theft) auto insurance. This not only means that you pay more co-pay, but it also means that the insurance company doesn't have to deal with smaller claims. For example, nobody with a $1000 deductible files a claim for an $800 repair. If the amount you owe is small compared to the car's bluebook value and is within $1000-$2000 of being paid off, the lender may allow you to drop collision and comprehensive coverage altogether \u2013 if you want to. All of these factors indicate that paying off most of the loan, but not all, may be the way to go.\n\nFinally, you could discuss with your lender the option of paying three-quarters of the loan off and refinancing the remainder as a 12-month deal, which could help reduce the burden of the remaining payment."}
{"2038": "\n\nThe following information is a brief excerpt from my book, \"The Small Stock Trader.\" The market sentiment is the most influential non-company-specific factor affecting stock prices, while the earning power of the company is the most significant company-specific factor. Technical analysis is primarily related to psychology and emotions, whereas fundamental analysis is more focused on reason. Therefore, fundamental analysis advises what to trade, and technical analysis advises when to trade. Many stock traders use technical analysis as a timing tool to determine their entry and exit points, mainly for short-term trading, and it works best with large caps. Small caps are more affected by company-specific news and speculation. Therefore, small stock traders should avoid over-analyzing the financial position, market position, and management of focus companies as it is challenging to make wise trading decisions based solely on fundamental analysis.\n\nInstead, traders should focus on a few essential figures and ratios such as trends, comparisons with competitors, and industry averages to make better trading decisions. Furthermore, it's advisable to use a combination of ratios and figures instead of relying on single metrics. Technical analysis is the study of supply and demand for a stock, predicting and following trends. By focusing on a few small caps, traders can use basic principles of technical analysis to identify supply and demand trends.\n\nThere are different ways to make money in the stock market, and successful traders employ a combination of fundamental and technical analysis.

The analogy used in the parable was difficult to follow, and I did not have the \"aha\" moment I was hoping for. Nevertheless, I agree with the point of view presented, which is that the United States will face significant challenges in supporting its debt habit, energy consumption, and currency in the long run.\n\nRegarding an investment strategy to protect oneself, here are some thoughts to consider. These points should be part of an overall strategy and are not complete in themselves. If the U.S. continues amassing debt at its current rate, it will be considered a worse credit risk, necessitating higher interest rates on its debt. Therefore, long-term treasury bonds may not be the best place to invest currently as they will decline as rates increase. Additionally, the U.S. will continue to print money to pay its mounting debt and debt servicing costs, which will inflate prices and put downward pressure on the U.S. dollar relative to stronger economies. As a result, U.S. cash and short-term treasuries may not be the best place to invest either. An alternative would be to hedge with inflation-indexed bonds (e.g., TIPS) or bonds from stronger major economies, but diversification is key.\n\nIf you believe that energy prices are headed higher, especially relative to the U.S. dollar, consider investing in world energy producing companies. Additionally, practicing broad, global diversification already offers some reasonable protection. It is crucial to diversify across various types of stocks, bonds, and economies, rather than limiting investments to just U.S. stocks and bonds.\n\nFinally, I do not underestimate the U.S.'s ability to overcome challenges and innovate, as U.S. history has shown. Therefore, I am keeping a small portion of my portfolio invested in strong U.S. companies that are proven innovators and have global reach, but not those that rely on financial innovation."}

To provide a brief overview, one method of valuing a going concern company is by using the present value of a growing perpetuity formula, assuming compounding perpetual growth.

Comparable transactions are often used as a benchmark to determine the value of such companies, with the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio being an inverse indicator of a growing perpetuity. When it comes to pre-revenue companies, the financial risks are high, and investors, such as VCs, will require significant returns, which usually involves them taking a large chunk of the company in the seed rounds. As a company starts to make sales and establishes itself in the market, the risks decrease, and its growth rate can be estimated with more precision. Established companies turning a recurrent level of profit are easier to value as their financial mathematics are more appropriate, and their value will be determined by current market conditions as well as comparable transactions.

It is recommended that those seeking financing speak directly with a lender to determine their options and the conditions of the loan.

It's not advisable to do so as it can raise personal implications. FinCEN cannot discover the ownership of bitcoins unless informed of it. Furthermore, if using the latest generation of HD wallets, the private key changes with each transaction, making it impractical to notify every time of ownership.\n\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that when bitcoins are stored in a foreign exchange, the owner does not technically have control over the coins. The exchange owns the private key, and any situation that doesn't involve owning the private keys and the ability to spend means the coins are not in your possession.\n\nTo conclude, holding bitcoins is not illegal, and FinCEN does not need to be informed of private key ownership."}
{"2054": "\n\nAs someone who has worked in the financial industry, I have a simple two-part solution. First, lenders, vendors, and financial institutions should turn off all forms of overdraft protection. This way, if there are no available funds during a pin-presented transaction, the payment will be declined without any fees, overdrafts, or complications. Secondly, recurring transactions with merchants such as Netflix or Gold's Gym are allowed because they are guaranteed payment from financial institutions, which avoids any issues. However, gift cards are the only option that won't cost you more money than you intend to spend. Keep in mind that some financial institutions may terminate business with you if there are too many non-payment periods. In summary, if you want to avoid paying more than you have, gift cards are the best option. They can be recharged anytime, and if an issue arises, you can simply purchase a new card to start over."}

As an Australian who has worked for several companies across multiple countries, I have discovered that there are many opportunities in different places, but also numerous challenges. When it comes to asset classes, real estate is a popular choice, but investing in rental residential or commercial property could be risky if you don't plan to stay in a country for at least one or two years. Understanding local laws and regulations, securing credit from local banks, and identifying suitable locations require time and expertise. Therefore, stocks and bonds are often the preferred investment options, as you can purchase them in any country. Diversifying your portfolio across various countries can help protect against market fluctuations and foreign exchange risks, but it also entails filling out tax returns in each country you earn income, which can be a daunting task. While it may be tempting to invest in several countries, I suggest focusing on one where you intend to spend most of your life and keeping a few investments in other places. Finally, as many expats eventually return to their home country, it's essential to consider factors such as family, friends, and cultural ties when making investment decisions."}

A company may repurchase shares in order to improve its financial position. For example, if Company A wants to open a new store, it must purchase land, construct the building, and stock the store, all of which requires a significant amount of money. The company could use a loan, accrued capital, or issue new stock to finance this expansion. However, issuing new stock has its drawbacks, one of which is the dilution of existing shares, lowering their value. By issuing more shares to raise capital in the future, the company is further diluted, perpetuating the cycle. To avoid this, a company may repurchase shares when they are undervalued, reducing the number of diluting shares and increasing the value of the remaining shares. This, in turn, reduces the cost of capital for the company when it needs to raise funds in the future. Thus, share repurchases are more about reducing the cost of capital for the company rather than rewarding shareholders."}

Your financial history suggests that you are a high-risk borrower. While your household income of 7k/month is above average, the fact that you are not able to save or invest any of it indicates a behavioral issue rather than a mathematical one. For instance, why do you have a car payment instead of purchasing a vehicle outright? By reducing your expenses, such as rent (1100), car payment (400), insurance (300), and other outgoings (1000), you should be able to clear at least 4000 per month in disposable income. Therefore, it is important to identify where your spending leaks are coming from and address them through budgeting and tracking your expenses. \n\nCutting back your spending, working a second job, or finding ways to increase your income could help you save for a down payment on a home within ten months or less.

Stocks trading at higher prices have more influence on the index than those trading at lower prices. \n\nGoogle, priced at almost $700 per share, would contribute five to twenty times more weight to the index than most other stocks in the index. This means small changes in Google's price would dominate the index on any given day. Apple, which traded around $700 per share until its 7:1 stock split in 2014, may be a candidate for inclusion in the DJIA next time the components change. Since the Dow is fixed at 30 stocks, and the index tries to maintain a balance between different sectors, removing another technology company may be required. \n\nPrice-weighting is uncommon in stock indices; most indices are weighted according to market capitalization, where the influence of a single company is proportional to its total value.

The S&P 500 is an index of 500 large-cap common stocks that are actively traded in the United States, compiled and published since 1957. This index is capitalization-weighted and free-float, meaning that the committee who selects the stocks ensures they are publicly traded on the two largest American stock exchanges, the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ. The selection process is guided by the need to represent various industries within the American economy, hence privately or mutually held companies and stocks that lack liquidity are excluded. The weight of each stock in the S&P 500 index is based on the market capitalization, and any changes in the stock price have a corresponding effect on the weight of that particular stock. If a stock value rises, its weight in the index increases; if it goes down too much, it will be replaced.

{"2088": "\n\nYour question is quite complex as it requires knowledge of the investor's market beliefs. For any quantitative portfolio, an estimate of the expected return vector and covariance matrix of the assets in question is fundamental. However, estimating the expected return vector can be difficult as there is no consensus on what it should be, and there is no clear way of determining who is right or wrong. In a world that meets the conditions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), this uncertainty can be bypassed as the main implication of the model is that the market weights are optimal. Therefore, to answer your question in such a scenario, one should determine the market weights of the various assets and use those alongside saving in a risk-free account or borrowing, depending on the risk tolerance of the investor. Moreover, this approach has the advantage of requiring minimal rebalancing since the weights in the portfolio adjust at the same rate as the market weights. However, any portfolio that includes factors beyond CAPM's fair pricing will also include some notion of expected return, which raises the question of whether you have such a notion. If you do, you can combine your information with the market weights to construct a portfolio. The Black-Litterman method, for instance, takes the expected return vector implied by market weights and the covariance matrix and blends it with the investor's expected return vector before using mean-variance optimization to generate the final portfolio weights."}

If the dealer can offer a sufficient discount, they would be foolish not to fulfill the order.\n\nAdditionally, your assumption that all orders are unique is not accurate. Dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP) typically prompt planned purchases on a fixed day and are often spread out over a period, such as ten days.

{"2093": "\n\nTo simplify this analysis, let's consider the \"what-ifs.\" As per the amortization formula and the numbers provided by you, your current interest rate is 3.75%. Also, you have already made 17 semi-monthly payments of $680.04 out of a 30-year, 720-payment loan term. If you choose to pay an additional $100 every two weeks towards your mortgage, your semi-monthly payments will increase to $780, and you can pay off the mortgage in 23 years instead of 30. This means you will make 557 payments instead of 703, reducing your payments from $478,040 to $434,460. This will save you $43,580 in interest costs over time. \n\nOnce the mortgage is paid off, you will have $780 semi-monthly for the remaining 73 months of your original 30-year loan (a total of $113,880) to invest elsewhere. The future value annuity formula can be used to determine the interest rate required to receive $113,880 over the course of 24 payments. Assuming that you invest this money in a security that provides the same interest rate you currently receive, you will need an APR of 3.07% on the account to accrue the same amount of savings as you would by paying off the mortgage.\n\nHowever, you are unlikely to keep your savings in your mattress. Rather, you might invest the money in the same security you are considering now. If you choose this route, the interest rate on the account must be greater than 3.75% to compensate for the interest you would have saved by paying down your mortgage. \n\nIt is important to note that the real-time value of the money remains the same, no matter how you invest it. Additionally, if you live in the United States, the interest charges on your mortgage are tax-deductible. So if you are in the most common wage-earner tax bracket, you will miss out on $10,895 in potential tax savings over the life of the loan. If you subtract these extra taxes, the break-even APR on the annuity account is about 3.095%. \n\nIn short, paying off the mortgage can save you a considerable amount of money in interest costs. However, you must consider the potential tax deductions and invest your savings wisely to maximize your profits."}

{"2102": "\n\nThe goal is to accomplish two objectives by going public: to become publicly traded and to increase wealth. The real profits are not solely based on the cash flow; rather, the profits come from the market valuing the company at a higher price. For instance, assuming a company brings in $1000 of cash flow and distributes it among its employees and owners, the company's potential to increase to $2000 the following year and $4000 the year after can lead to positive outcomes for everyone involved, especially if they decide to go public. In such a case, the company's promoters and employees with options or RSUs will benefit greatly from its increased visibility. Google and Facebook did not require the IPO proceeds when they went public since they had enough cash from their businesses, but the move helped increase their net worth significantly. By selling just a small percentage of shares on the public market, the company can be valued highly, factoring in future cash flows using a discount rate, among other factors. Rather than waiting for the profits to accumulate over the next 15 years, the company would get to enjoy them instantly."}

Most papers agree that, according to the efficient market hypothesis and arbitrage theory, the value of an equity is reflected by its price at any given point in time.

{"2108": "\n\nFirst, it is important to clarify that the term \"resistance\" should be used instead of \"support\" when referring to above the current price level. Secondly, relying on a moving average (MA) as a support or resistance level means that it will adjust as the price fluctuates, rather than remaining static at a set price point.\n\nGenerally, stocks tend to move in a range trade more frequently than they trend significantly up or down. It is not unusual for a stock to fluctuate between support and resistance levels for months, or even years. The longer a stock remains in a range trade, the more dramatic the breakout will be when it inevitably occurs.\n\nUsing MAs, particularly shorter ones, as a support or resistance line is most effective when a stock is already trending up or down. In cases where a stock is moving laterally, it is more likely to cross over the MA frequently, which can result in being whipsawed if the MA is used as a trigger to enter or exit a position.\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider two charts. In the first chart, the stock has been trending upwards for six months, with the 50-day EMA serving as its support or trendline. As long as the stock price remains above the 50-day EMA, the uptrend should continue. Using the EMA as an entry point or stop loss level may be appropriate for this situation.\n\nIn contrast, the second chart depicts a stock that has been range trading between a support line at $21.80 and resistance level at $25.50 for ten months. During this time, the stock price has repeatedly crossed above and below the 50-day EMA. Attempting to trade every break above or below the EMA can result in whipsawing. Instead, it may be wiser to buy when the stock approaches the support line and sell when it nears the resistance line.\n\nIt is essential to use different strategies when a stock is range trading compared to when it is trending. During a trend, MAs can be useful as an entry signal, but range trading requires different tactics. When going long, place stops just below the support line, and when going short, place stops just above the resistance level. This approach ensures that if the stock breaks through support or resistance and starts to trend, you are covered."}

{"2114": "\n\nMy experience is only within the United States. Previously, American Express marketed its products as more prestigious and exclusive compared to other cards. They aimed to create the impression that cardholders were financially qualified. This led to higher fees for both merchants and cardholders. During the early 1990s, people didn't often use credit cards for small purchases like groceries or fast food. Instead, they used them for bigger purchases like jewelry, electronics, or meals at high-end restaurants. As credit card usage became prevalent for everyday purchases, there was a shift towards acquiring the highest number of customers, rather than people of higher financial status. As a result, the transaction volume for Visa (and to some extent for Mastercard) increased significantly, while the use of American Express decreased. Merchants became less interested in accepting American Express cards as their customer base changed. As a merchant, to accept credit cards, it's necessary to establish a bank account and maintain a merchant account. However, accepting Visa, MC, and Discover can be done under one account. In contrast, American Express requires a separate relationship, along with its own set of rules and fees, which tend to be higher. Since there are fewer American Express cardholders than there are Visa cardholders, there's some doubt about whether accepting the card is worthwhile. Merchants decide based on their customer base. Generally, high-end restaurants still accept American Express."}
{"2115": "\n\nHave you ever saved money before? Even if you haven't, chances are you've had to gather some cash for a particular purpose at some point in your life. In my experience, creating a more engaging approach to saving, like setting aside funds for specific goals, tends to yield better results than simply saving for a rainy day without any clear objective in mind. \n\nTo start, divide your money into different categories based on your goals. For example, you could set up a separate savings account for your new car fund, keep your emergency stash in cash at home, and invest in stocks for your new business capital. By doing this, you begin to distance yourself from the traditional concept of simply saving money without any clear idea of what the funds will be used for. \n\nIt's worth noting that savings accounts don't typically yield much in terms of returns, and inflation can quickly erode any gains made.

Furthermore, there are limited physical and legal boundaries to how much you can expand your home, with zoning restrictions in most markets, and eventually a cap on lot size. Continuously obtaining loans for expansion will result in diminishing returns in the eyes of potential buyers. While a third or fourth bedroom may be desirable, a second billiards room or third home theater is unlikely to significantly influence offers.

To rectify this issue, the current assets and current liabilities must first be balanced out before adding cash and equivalents. Therefore, the revised formula for excess cash would be: Excess Cash = Current Assets - Current Liabilities + Cash & Equivalents.

{"2122": "\n\nMaria, when considering this problem, there are several questions to ponder. Firstly, do fundamental or technical strategies provide valuable insights? Secondly, are the signals they generate actionable? Based on my experience, technical analysis usually does not provide any meaningful information. While you can identify certain phenomena and indicators when looking back at data, these observations are usually not actionable in real-time. Conversely, fundamentals can play a critical role in the overall, typically long-term, dynamics of stock movement. For example, buying stocks with the best P/E ratios can make sense from a logical perspective and may have some long-term merit. However, there is always the risk that an internal blowup or macro event could result in significant losses.\n\nTo strike a balance, we could consider using fundamentals to identify promising long-term growth indicators (what quants might call \"drift\"). Then, we could limit ourselves to equities in a particular index, such as the S&P500, and compare their growth with their P/E ratios. We could even do some regression for good measure. A natural strategy would be to sell equities that have exceeded their expected return given the P/E ratio and buy those that have underperformed. Since all the equities we are considering are in the same index, they are likely to be somewhat correlated, especially when traded in baskets. If we sell ten equities deemed \"too high\" and buy ten that are \"too low,\" we'll take a neutral position and bet on convergence of the spread to the market average growth. We've thus constructed a hedged position using a fundamental metric and some helpful statistics. This method may be classified as a type of index arbitrage, and it can be conducted in a similar manner. By digging through data on the S&P500 over the past five years on platforms like Yahoo Finance, you'll likely find plenty of signals that could be profitable if calibrated with specific numbers. Sorry for the long and rambling style, but I wanted to touch on key points and demonstrate some clever ways to use fundamentals."}

It may be more economical to repair your car instead of purchasing a new one, but you must determine the cost of repairs and evaluate your financial situation accordingly. To repair your car, you may have to suspend payments on non-essential expenses such as medical debt. Although some of these solutions may harm your credit score, going further into debt to preserve your credit score could potentially worsen your current situation.

{"2130": "\n\nWhen it comes to selling stocks, there are various options, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. While a put option is a reliable but costly choice, a sell stop order is less expensive but less dependable. A put option is similar to an insurance policy on a stock, where you pay a preset price, securing a sale price for a specific future date. If the stock depreciates significantly, you exercise the option and sell it at the contract price. On the other hand, if the stock value goes up, you can let the contract expire and keep the stock. However, relying on put options long-term can be unfavorable since each expired contract will offset earnings, reducing profits.\n\nA sell stop order is generally cheaper but not as secure, and you set a trigger price, like a 10% loss of the stock's current value. If the stock hits the threshold, it then triggers a sell order, and the broker will sell the stock on the market, take their commission, and you will receive the remainder of the sale. Nonetheless, this process can only be completed if a buyer is willing to purchase at the price at the moment the trigger fires. If the stock value drops rapidly or there isn't a buyer at that price, the order may not complete until the loss reaches more than the desired 10%, even up to 20%.\n\nA sell stop limit is a combination stop order and limit order. These orders define a selling range by determining a band within which the stock will be sold, not above or below the specified price. This allows you to limit losses and determine the price at which the stock should be sold. The price range must be realistic and broad enough to ensure that the sell order executes, which can save you from significant losses.\n\nAnother option is a swaption, which involves buying a put option on one financial instrument and a call on another. This option contract specifies a swap, allowing you to exchange your stock for another instrument if it becomes favorable. For instance, you could swap an airline stock for oil. If the value of oil surges, the airline stock value will drop sharply, allowing you to avoid losses and reap gains on the swap. However, swaptions can also be expensive, and sellers will want a high return if they bet against you.\n\nIn summary, selling stocks involves making various choices, each with its advantages and disadvantages. It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor before making any significant investment decisions."}

Nonetheless, a black market exists (illegal in Venezuela but legal in the US), where the price of exchange fluctuates much higher than official rates, as much as 900 according to Valuewalk, with slightly different official rates. Valuewalk delves into the different exchange rates in detail, explaining that there are presently four exchange rates. The first, called CENCOEX, represents the official exchange rate of 6.30 bolivars to the dollar, and is only intended for the importation of food and medicine. The next two rates, SICAD I (12 bolivars per dollar) and SICAD 2 (50 bolivars per dollar), assign dollars to enterprises that import all other types of goods.

{"2135": "\n\nA lease is essentially a rental agreement. You obtain financing to cover the expected depreciation during the lease term. This arrangement typically results in higher costs over the course of your \"ownership.\" However, this does not necessarily mean that a lease is always a worse option. Cars are generally a depreciating asset, with the exception of luxury models that are scarce and highly sought after. When you take ownership of a car, it begins to lose value, and new cars generally lose value at a faster rate than used ones. If you were to purchase a new car and then sell it after three years, the overall cost would likely be less than leasing the same car for 36 months. However, purchasing a car requires a substantial down payment or higher monthly payments, and you would need to sell the car after the 36 months. Certain cars lease better than others because their projected depreciation is more favorable. Personally, I purchased a slightly used car with a factory warranty extension. For my next vehicle, I may choose to lease since late-model cars are becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. It's important to keep in mind that even though leasing provides convenience, cash flow flexibility, and eliminates the need to sell or trade-in the car, the total cost over the same time frame will be higher than purchasing the vehicle."}

One option to consider is using a credit card to fund your startup, ideally through a balance transfer at 0% interest for $10k. This way, if your startup takes off, your Roth IRA remains untouched. However, relying solely on $10k in savings to quit your job and pursue a startup may not be the most comfortable situation. Ultimately, the decision is yours."}

{"2139": "\n\nMany individuals have supplied excellent answers to the inquiry at hand and have given sound advice with convincing justifications. Below are some additional insights to consider regarding the matter. \n\n1) The investment manager inquiry: Although the returns on your capital have been relatively low for the past six months, it is essential to recognize that some investments require more time to yield significant growth. You could schedule a meeting with your investment manager to inquire about where your funds have been invested and the reason for the low returns. If your investment manager is unwilling to provide a satisfactory explanation (as you have stated in your query), it is advisable to follow Xolorus & Pete\u2019s advice and withdraw all of your capital from the investment manager and store it in a bank account until you find a suitable alternative investment option. \n\n2) Finance is not my forte: At the age of 22, it is natural that financial matters may not come easily to you. However, it would be beneficial to explore why you assume finance to be difficult for you. As a computer science graduate, you should possess ample mathematical competency for financial matters. Perhaps you have not closely examined finance as a career option until now. For instance, self-learning is one approach, as several helpful books and online resources about finances are available. \n\n3) If finance interests you: If you consider finance to be of interest to you, it may be worthwhile to set aside a portion of your $30,000 as a seed fund, such as $2,000, to experiment with investing in the market using instruments that you find comfortable. Additionally, since you are young and can afford to assume risk, other low-risk options that you have discovered via self-study could be an excellent alternative for the rest of your funds. \n\n4) If finance does not interest you: If you are not interested in finance, then an investment manager may be the best option. As noted earlier, finding a trustworthy and reputable investment advisor may take some time, but it is worth the effort in the end. \n\n5) On returns: As previously mentioned, different investment instruments yield varying returns. However, one common question is the expected return on an investment; you were hoping for more than $12 from your investment. Answering this question is challenging, as a person's investment returns and desired financial goals dictate the answer. Nonetheless, a practical way to gauge the expectation on investment returns is to take a 15- to 20-year compounded average growth rate (CAGR) of the stock index and lower it by 2-3%, which is a modest projection of medium-to-long-term prospects (in most, but not all cases)."}
{"2140": "\n\nIt is essential to review the terms of your mortgage. If you are in a fixed-term mortgage, you may be able to overpay a specific amount of the capital annually, typically around 10%. For instance, if you currently owe \u00a3300,000, you can pay an additional \u00a330,000 this year, leaving you with a balance of approximately \u00a3260,000 next year, allowing you to pay \u00a326,000. However, it is crucial to check your mortgage terms to determine the applicable limits. It is possible to overpay beyond the limit, but you may become liable for an early repayment fee, usually ranging between 3-5% of the mortgage amount. In such cases, you would need to refinance the mortgage anyway. \n\nOn the other hand, if you are not on a fixed-term mortgage, you are generally free to overpay as much as you desire or refinance the mortgage, at least in the UK. If you have a fixed-term mortgage, it is advisable to overpay the maximum allowed amount until the fixed period expires. You can then refinance onto a mortgage that allows higher overpayments. However, this may differ depending on your interest rate, the early repayment charge limit, and your ability to overpay. Therefore, some calculations are necessary. If you choose to overpay within the limit, it would be best to do it at the beginning of the year, paying the total amount instead of dividing it by 12. This can help to lower your interest payments. When you have reached the limit, you can save the rest of the money in a savings account. After the fixed period ends, you can pay the remaining amount as a lump sum when refinancing."}
{"2141": "\n\nOne issue to consider is that each deferred account will have its own Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) once you reach retirement or age 70.5. While Roths aren't subject to RMDs at first, they are once the account creator has passed away. Having fewer accounts simplifies the RMD process, but it's still important to remember to check each account when liquidating holdings in a particular security to avoid forgetting about investments in another account. Additionally, fees may be assessed for each sale, as Chris noted. This is particularly relevant when investing heavily in one type of investment in each account, as RMDs can force you to sell at the wrong time. To avoid this, spread similar investments across multiple accounts to retain flexibility in meeting an RMD. Ultimately, having fewer accounts can make it easier to avoid this particular issue."}
{"2142": "\n\nRevised: If your effective rate after taxes is higher than the inflation rate, your wealth will decrease. For instance, if your interest rate is R and your marginal tax rate is T, you require R*(1-T) to be lower than the inflation rate to make a loan worthwhile. Recently, inflation has fluctuated between 1% and 1.8%. Assuming a 25% tax rate, is your interest rate less than 1.3% to 2.4%? If not, refrain from taking out the loan. A loan comes with additional responsibilities, such as inspections, appraisals, and origination charges that add up and become part of the closing costs. Therefore, it is better to avoid them if possible. For example, I recently bought a house using 100% cash, saving me significant time and money. My final closing costs were not in the thousands, but only a few hundred dollars. Thus, loans are not recommended, and avoiding them can save you both time and money."}
{"2143": "\n\nWhile I am not intimately familiar with the situation in Australia, I am aware that in the US, there is an interventionist philosophy that has been adopted by those in power. To keep interest rates low, the Federal Reserve (Central Bank) is buying back US Government debt, and the government is keeping mortgage rates low by utilizing the proceeds of cheap bond sales to buy mortgages. Although this is not directly related to Australia, it is relevant because the largest capital markets are in the US, which influences the markets in other countries.\n\nIn the US, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a survey that encompasses all urban consumers. It is important to note that younger, middle-class consumers with anticipated income growth will experience shifting costs more rapidly than elderly or poor individuals who may already own or reside in subsidized housing and spend less on transportation. For example, my parents are in their early 60s and still reside in the house where I grew up. Since they own the property outright, they are not affected by the recent fluctuation in housing prices, and there are many individuals in similar situations."}

It may not significantly affect your monthly budget or grow to a sum that lets you live rent-free, for example. As a result, my advice differs from the other answers given thus far. If I were in your position, I would suggest dividing the money in two. Put $25,000 into investments or savings and use the other half to travel. \n\nWithin this budget, you could plan a trip to Europe, South America, Asia, or Australia. Request three to six months off from work, or if that is not possible, consider quitting if you must. Determine several places you would like to visit and make sure to allocate plenty of time to explore each one. Reserve flights in advance as necessary or book one-way and pay for your return trip when you have a better understanding of your schedule. Consider staying in hostels, a tent, or affordable Airbnb accommodations. Take advantage of opportunities to meet other travelers and local residents. Identify your basic expenses per day and budget a little extra for things like food, drinks, entertainment, and souvenirs.\n\nIt is now easier than ever to travel to various destinations and be open to spontaneous adventures. The world is full of distinctive cultures, people, and sights that will broaden your horizons and help you make new friends. Some of the places you visit may be etched in your memory forever.

{"2147": "\n\nI am raising this question because startups carry a high level of risk, and it's often argued that 99% of them fail and lead to financial loss. However, this statistic is exaggerated; research shows that 96% of companies fail within ten years. Nonetheless, launching a successful business isn't solely dependent on luck. Rather, it primarily hinges on the strength of the business idea, and the entrepreneur's skills and resources to execute it. While there's always an element of luck involved, a savvy businessperson can evaluate the risks and potential rewards before deciding whether to pursue a venture or not. Furthermore, a failed business doesn't automatically denote that the business owner lacked skill. Indeed, a smart entrepreneur knows when it's time to walk away. Sometimes, even a lucrative business can face unforeseen changes in the market, rendering it unprofitable. In such cases, a wise owner liquidates unviable assets and pivots to another business opportunity. Only those who hesitate to let go of a failing enterprise risk being dragged down with it.\n\nSo, do you need to have a \"startup fund\"? Generally speaking, it's a smart move to save some of your disposable income for the future. Even if you never launch your own business, these savings could serve as retirement funds. As such, you should ideally put some amount of money aside every month. However, the question of whether to use these savings to start a business is highly dependent on whether you have a solid idea you're confident will succeed. To determine this, consider whether you can answer in the affirmative to all of the following questions, and if so, you may want to consider pursuing a business venture."}

{"2151": "\n\nI believe the statement is flawed, as investors should not go into an investment with the mindset that they might lose. The goal of investing is to earn, not to face losses. More often than not, losses stem from feelings of fear. It's crucial to remember that a loss only occurs if you sell for less than you purchased. Thus, if you possess patience, you can likely regain your investment. When discussing financial goals with my clients, they frequently say they want to earn \"as much as possible.\" However, this isn't a specific or achievable goal, and a strategy cannot be formed around it. Having an exit strategy is vital, as it enables you to exit a stock with ease. Without a strategy, you risk unending losses. I've been a successful trader for a long time, and it wasn't because I was prepared to lose but due to my entry and exit strategy. If you have a strategy in place, the idea of investing only what you can afford to lose becomes less relevant."}
{"2152": "\n\nShareholder's Equity has two main components: the initial capitalization of the company (including shares sold during the company's founding and subsequent share issues) and retained earnings, which refers to the net profits earned by the company that have not been distributed back to shareholders. This represents the firm's total equity financing. The initial capitalization is the equity put into the company when it was founded, along with any subsequent equity increases due to share issues. Retained earnings represent the equity increase that has not yet been distributed to shareholders. \n\nBoth accounts are credited when they increase since they reflect an increase in cash which is debited. However, this does not necessarily mean that the company has that much cash on hand since the cash will likely be reinvested. Shareholder's Equity is neither an asset nor a liability. Instead, it is used to purchase assets and reduce liabilities. It is simply a measure of assets minus liabilities that is necessary to balance the accounting equation. \n\nSince the book value of stocks does not change frequently, almost all changes in total assets or liabilities are captured in retained earnings. This is because the book value of stocks represents the price the company sold it for, not the current value on the stock market. Therefore, it changes only when there are new share issues."}

It's worth noting that if speculative activities are concerning to you, you may need to denounce several forms of currency.

These funds typically do not charge a fee, yet they direct your portfolio to actively managed funds. However, the \"acquired\" expense ratio of lifecycle funds is often lower than the cost of hiring a professional.

{"2163": "\n\nRemember that each share represents a vote at shareholders' meetings. When the share price decreases substantially below the percentage of the company's value, the company could be purchased and taken over. This usually establishes a minimum share price based on the company's present value. If the share price is anticipated to rise in the future, it may surpass that minimum value or drop slightly below if negative news is expected. As a result, investments in the stock market are regarded as speculation. If the selling price of a share is too high, people will not purchase it, setting the upper limit for any given time. Since part of this is conjecture, the market is not entirely rational, and prices may decrease even after positive news if the market's anticipation was excessively elevated.

As investors buy and sell shares of your fund, it is possible that certain periods will see a mismatch between your fund's portfolio and the S&P 500 due to cash inflows and outflows. For instance, if 98% of your fund's assets are invested in stocks that reflect the S&P 500, the remaining 2% held in a money market account might cause a deviation. \n\nTo better align with the S&P 500, you can invest a portion of the cash balance in a triple-leveraged fund (by taking 1/3 of the cash balance) or a double-leveraged fund (by investing 1/2 of the funds). This approach could help you more accurately track the index that your fund was designed to follow. While I am unsure of the percentage of mutual fund owners who keep cash on hand, this strategy is a specific use case for these ETFs. Over time, however, there may be a compounding effect on leveraged funds that results in beta slippage.

If you spend a considerable amount each month on coffee, such as $200, consider dropping that expense. However, if you only spend $10 a month, you need to focus your efforts elsewhere to achieve substantial savings. Establish a target for your savings and limit your spending accordingly. Analyze your previous month's expenses to see what adjustments need to be made. Identify the areas where you can easily cut costs, but also take into account your unique circumstances.

On the other hand, bonds increased in value, and if one had rebalanced by selling some bonds and buying more stocks, they would have profited greatly when the stock market recovered. The main reason for adding bonds to one's investments for diversification is that they tend to move in the opposite direction of equities, which helps cushion the impact of sharp declines and provides opportunities for buying at lower prices. REITs hardly fit these criteria. Unlike bonds, their value does not undergo a correction because their pricing is based on supply-demand dynamics in real estate, which is only minimally affected by rising interest rates. Although such rates might make it harder for buyers to purchase, other factors such as increased wealth in the economy for homebuyers tend to push real estate prices upward, counterbalancing any adverse effects."}

If it hadn't converted, it would either trade as a pure bond or a pure bond with a premium, depending on the stock price's proximity to the strike price and the remaining conversion privilege time. Generally, it doesn't make sense to convert below the strike price, and conversion far from maturity doesn't make sense either because the option premium vanishes above $2.

I invest using Vanguard personal investor and brokerage accounts. Below is a summary of the performance results from 2007 to present. The DBC commodity fund was created in 2007, so my results have been tested only since then. I have tested the broader asset class as well, and the results are similar. However, I suggest that you do this analysis for yourself as well. I use portfoliovisualizer.com to backtest the results of my portfolio along with various asset classes, which has been tremendously useful. I strongly recommend that you ignore local investment advisor recommendations. Nobody will ever care more about your money than you, and their incentives may be misaligned. We chose mutual funds over ETFs for the simplicity of automatic investment, but unfortunately, I have to manually buy the ETF shares each month (DBC and GLD). I am currently 29 years old and not using this approach for retirement savings. My retirement savings are 100% in VSMAX. I plan to adjust this in 20 years or so to be more conservative. However, when I approach retirement age, this is precisely where I want to be. Suppose you had $2.7M in your retirement account on Oct 31, 2007, invested in 100% US Stocks. In Feb of 2009, your balance would have been approximately $1.35M. If you intended to retire in 2009, you probably could not have done so. Had you invested using this approach, your account would have fallen to $2.4M in Feb 2009. Disclaimer: I'm not a financial planner or advisor, nor do I claim to be one.

{"2181": "\n\nRevised: Keith's response requires some correction, as the details regarding entrustment orders should have been referenced in your bank/broker's terms and conditions. An entrustment order functions as a \"soft\" limit order, but it lacks meaning without a validity period (usually ranging between 1 and 5 days). Suppose you opt to purchase silver at an entrustment price of x, exceeding the market offer of m. In such cases, your order will be partially filled at market prices, whereas the remaining amount will have a limit. Your bank/broker may fill your order at various prices over the next few days, ensuring that the total average price stays below x. This contrasts with a limit order, where any remaining amount of your order will remain unfilled if the market moves above x, resulting in partial fulfillment after 1-5 business days. Note that a lower entrustment price with a brief validity period functions as a limit order. Another form of order type to consider is the stop-buy, which triggers a purchase when the market offer exceeds a specific price, while a stop-sell engages a sale when the market bid quote falls below a specific price. This paired with the entrustment principle could lead to buying/selling above/below the quoted price. Keep in mind that in pro-rata markets, partial fulfillment may occur, even with large orders."}

It is recommended to seek professional tax advice as IRS rules can be complex. Tax Topic 415 Renting Residential and Vacation Property and IRS pub 527 Residential Rental Property provide information on the IRS rules that apply. Note that there is a special rule for rental periods of fewer than 15 days where rental income should not be reported and no expenses should be deducted. However, if you exceed this threshold, you will need to report the income and address items such as depreciation. This can add to the complexity of your tax situation, so it is best to avoid crossing the threshold. When a property is both a personal residence and a rental property, dividing expenses and determining the rental portion of the property can become complicated. The property value before the split and the rental portion's value at the time of the division must be determined. Depreciation of the rental portion must be followed according to IRS regulations until it is either converted back to non-rental or sold. When the property is sold, the sales price's portion associated with the rental property, as well as any profit or loss and depreciation recapture, will need to be determined. Keep in mind that AirBnB collects tax information and reports it to the IRS, and local laws, including zoning regulations and Home Owners Association rules, should also be researched.

Banks offer both \"balance sheet\" loans, where they assume the risks and gains from lending, and \"off balance sheet\" loans, where loans are sold off as securities. While major banks such as Chase and Citibank engage in both types of lending, some smaller firms specialize in managing assets for clients without taking full responsibility for the loans.

{"2189": "\n\nI will focus on the purchase price only. Generally, you cannot claim the entire purchase price in the year of purchase, but rather a percentage of the car's value each year, called the writing down allowance, which is a capital allowance. This allowance is similar to depreciation, but based on HRMC's formula. However, considering that the value of your car is less than \u00a31000, you can probably claim 95% of the purchase price. The HMRC webpage explains the process in more detail. You must record the value of any assets you are claiming writing down allowance on in one of the pools. The pool attracts the same rate of writing down allowance, and they are similar to accounts in accounting, having an opening and a closing balance. If you use an asset for personal use, it needs a pool to itself, which HRMC calls a single asset pool.\n\nTo start, look at the Business Cars section, and then the Rates for Cars section to determine the rate you can claim. Your car is likely in the special rate category. Special rate is 8% a year, main rate is 18%, and First year allowance is essentially 100%. After the purchase, you add the value of the car to the pool, reduce the value of the pool if you dispose of it in the same year, and claim the writing down allowance accordingly. If the car is worth more than \u00a31000, the process gets more complicated. If you sell or dispose of the car, it affects your profits. If you claim simplified mileage expenses, you cannot claim capital allowances separately.\n\nIn your case, you can claim 95% of the purchase price, and if you sell it, you add 95% of the sale price to your profits in that accounting period. However, if the car's value is above \u00a31000, the process is more complex. If you have queries, refer to the HMRC webpage or seek professional advice."}

Larger securities have a greater impact on the index's overall trajectory than smaller ones. For investment funds, such as ETFs or open-end funds, managing cash flows and tracking index updates, such as quarterly rebalancing or mergers, acquisitions or spin-offs, is important.\n\nIn some cases, an ETF may require work to determine the underlying securities when handling Creation and Redemption units. These funds generally have shares created in 50,000 shares at a time through Authorized Participants. On the other hand, an open-end fund requires daily management of share creation and redemption. \n\nA report on 'How to Beat the Benchmark' suggests that DFA's 9-10 Portfolio, which captures the return behavior of U.S. small company stocks, and Vanguard Extended Index Fund (Wilshire 4500) and Vanguard Index Trust 500, all showed above-average performance. DFA employs a \"patient buyer\" discount block trading strategy, which resulted in negative total trading costs, even in the poor liquidity of small company stocks. Essentially, they chose to buy and sell stocks at prices more favorable than market prices by waiting for a motivated seller to unload a large block, giving their fund the luxury of picking and choosing stocks at better prices. The returns are highest for the DFA 9-10 Fund, less in the Vanguard Small Cap Fund, less still in the Vanguard Index Extended Fund, and minimal with the S&P500. The conclusion drawn is that the biggest joke in the finance industry is value-added active management. Instead, to beat indexes, one should invest in an index fund."}

In contrast, margin investors in equities are typically long in \"equities\", creating a higher likelihood of large margin calls occurring simultaneously. Additionally, it is worth noting that high-frequency traders, who are often highly leveraged, may comprise a significant proportion of volume in liquid markets such as equity markets (~70% in this instance). However, this raises questions around the artificiality of this volume figure and its true meaning.\n\nIn contrast, the primary holders of long-term positions in the FX markets are non-investment arm banks, central banks, and corporations. Unlike the equity markets, currency markets need to maintain trading activity for many corporations and banks to conduct their business. This depth of liquidity enables brokers in this market to offer leverage ratios as high as 400-to-1, though it is not necessarily advantageous for customers.\n\nIn summary, the two-sided nature of currency contracts and the diversity of clients make leverage less problematic compared to the equity markets, where margin investors are predominantly long.

Additionally, putting 20% down can be beneficial in avoiding PMI altogether. \n\nRegarding your credit score, adding accounts back as revolving accounts may have a negative or negligible effect on it. It's unclear which way the score will sway or how significant the impact will be. It might be worth disputing any items on your credit report that seem inaccurate, regardless of whether you plan to pursue an FHA loan. \n\nLastly, it's wise to shop around for mortgage lenders and look for ones that are considered \"portfolio lenders.\" These types of lenders typically have more flexibility in terms of who they can lend to and the type of loans they offer."}

Although you invested $10k and earned a return of $20k, the valuation of the asset between purchase and sale is insignificant since the cash gain is $10k. From an accounting standpoint, the company bears the loss as they sold the asset for $40k under par. As the buyer, you only observe the initial purchase and sale of the capital asset. For instance, a firm acquires a vehicle for $20,000, depreciates it to a book value of $2,000, and then sells it for $3,000 to a consumer. Does the buyer suffer a $1,000 loss? No. Does the firm gain $1,000? Yes. Your analogy of a bank is flawed in two ways:"}

{"2226": "\n\nFirst, let's clarify some terminology: I believe you're proposing to sell 10,000 shares of a company's stock, not \"10,000 stocks.\" When selling, you must decide whether you're willing to sell for a specific minimum price or at any price. If you set a minimum asking price, and no one is willing to pay it, your shares won't sell.  This approach may result in selling only a few shares, or none at all if your asking price is deemed unreasonable. Alternatively, if you choose to sell regardless of the price, flooding the market with your shares may cause the price per share to decrease until a buyer is willing to buy. The lower limit of your asking price depends on how people value the stock at that time. Managing these complexities is not something I am interested in, which is why I prefer to invest in index funds."}

Institutional investors dominate bond markets, meaning a $100 million bond issuance is typically owned and held to maturity by only 10-20 investors such as banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds. Consequently, bonds may only trade a few times per month or year. In contrast, equity offerings may have hundreds or thousands of owners who trade daily, particularly if they are included in an active stock index. While limited, Fidelity's website may offer some bond data to account holders. Best of luck in your search."}
{"2229": "\n\nPossible revised text:\n\nThere are two main methods for reaching out to potential targets: using an autodialer to send SMS or make direct calls to lists of phone numbers. Autodialers can be operated on a personal computer through VoIP or other third-party services. To obtain phone numbers, some may purchase lists from reputable sources that follow opt-out regulations, while others may randomly dial numbers within a certain range, regardless of their accuracy.\n\nIn more sophisticated operations, autodialer returns are handled by human operators in a call center that follows up on interested parties. In less formal operations, returns are used to build a screened list of valid phone numbers that can be sold to other agencies for profit. From a SMS perspective, anyone can subscribe to a vendor-level SMS Gateway that allows receiving and responding to SMS messages. Success in this approach relies on a \"law of large numbers\" strategy, where reaching out to thousands of potential targets may yield a small number of receptive replies.\n\nUnfortunately, scams and unwanted spam messages can exploit the gullibility of a few targets to the detriment of the rest of us.

While I have never been audited, which may suggest that my tax forms were plausible to the IRS and therefore generally correct, it also indicates that the IRS has never verified the accuracy of my tax forms. With that said, here are some key points: \n\n1. Creating a Limited Liability Company (LLC) isn't necessary to claim business expenses. Regardless of whether you have expenses or not, you'll have to fill out a schedule C. You'll find spaces for expenses in various categories on this form. It's crucial to note that if you have any property that is used for both personal and business use, you'll need to calculate business use percentage to claim deductions. Keeping a log is necessary to justify the percentage. The IRS looks at claims of business use of cars and computers with suspicion due to their capacity for personal usage. Claiming office use of your home is legal, provided that you exclusively use one or more rooms for business purposes.\n\n2. Acquiring a financial advisor might be a wise decision. The compensation for the advisor comes from the investment company if you have enough assets in your account. Otherwise, an hourly fee might apply.\n\n3. You've got to pay taxes on business income. If you haven't established an LLC or a corporation, your business income will be added to your wage income when calculating tax. You're required to pay quarterly estimated taxes if the withholding on your paycheck doesn't cover taxes entirely. You'll be penalized if you skip paying estimated taxes. Don't forget that you're liable for state income tax and self-employment tax.\n\n4. Once tax and business expenses are taken care of, you can do whatever you want with the rest of your income. Nonetheless, if you ever need some inspiration on how to spend it, feel free to make a contribution to my kids' college funds!"}

The only situation where a securities license would be necessary is if a legal entity holds the coins, and you deal or broker an interest in that entity.

These providers may state their terms for service and may refuse service before any payment is made. It's important to state your terms in your post so prospective buyers are aware of them.

During the financial crisis, the FED printed over $1 trillion and bought various securities, including Mortgage Backed Securities and Credit Default Swaps, often purchasing them at face value rather than market value. This allowed banks to offload risky investments and maintain liquidity. In November 2010, the FED announced its plan to print an additional $600 billion and purchase all of the US government's debt for the next eight months. This move, referred to as \"monetizing\" the federal debt, was likely due to a lack of willing buyers for US debt, including China and the Social Security Trust Fund, which is experiencing a deficit."}

Reg SHO is implemented to ensure that naked short sellers cover their positions in order to prevent abusive failure to deliver instances, where a person shorts a stock without borrowing shares. It is worth noting that naked short selling is not a violation of federal securities laws, but it can create an accounting problem if multiple parties claim ownership of the same underlying assets. In some cases, individuals may be unaware that they are in a naked short position, and consequently they may be required to cover their position. When other individuals are forced to cover, it can lead to a potential short squeeze, which is a risk. Additionally, there are costs associated with covering a short position, such as interest on borrowings and payment of dividends, where applicable. While these costs may be negligible in shorter timeframes, they can significantly impact returns over a longer period. It is also important to consider the costs of the market moving against the short position, as well as transaction fees."}

Although I did not plan to exercise my options, I did not contact my broker to clarify the statement. It is advisable to avoid situations where a broker needs to act on your account. Additionally, while it is possible to sell options in most scenarios, illiquid options may have large spreads between bid and ask prices, resulting in a significant loss. Therefore, I often adjust my limit price near expiry day to ensure a profitable sale. If faced with a similar situation, it is wise to communicate with your broker to request they sell the options rather than exercise them at the expense of other positions."}

{"2239": "\n\nAfter reading this, I realized I was tempted to go into the debt collection business by randomly sending letters to people demanding money. However, I was only joking about that. If you are receiving such letters at a Virginia PO Box, you can simply close it without leaving a forwarding address, and consider the issue closed. On the other hand, if they are targeting you personally in New Hampshire, I suggest that you be proactive and sue before it goes to collection. New Hampshire has strict anti-debt-collection laws, and you can do this by going to small claims court and filling out a one-page form without hiring a lawyer. You can sue them for convenient amounts like $2000 or $3000. You can claim that they violated the creditor of NH FDCA laws, and that they are extorting money from you illegally. You do not necessarily need to prove the validity of your claims to get them to court. If they fail to show up, you win, and they will owe you the amount you sued them for. If they do show up and hire a lawyer, you can accept the court's offer for arbitration and drop the lawsuit if they send you a check for $500 and a written guarantee that you will never hear from the client again.\n\nOne important note is that if you only receive calls from debt collectors who refuse to identify themselves, this may be an illegal scam. In New Hampshire, it is illegal for collection calls to refuse to identify who is calling. You can file a police report and call your phone company to trace the call and identify the caller. If they are calling from within the jurisdiction, you can file a criminal complaint against them."}

{"2241": "\n\nStores prefer customers to use cash, as it encourages them to use it in the future. Personally, I feel a little uneasy using my bank card at the store since I know that approximately 2-3% of the sale goes to the bank. Unless I dislike the store, I tend to use cash when possible. While it's likely that large stores don't pay extra for handling cash, it's crucial for them to have it available. Is it common in other countries not to mind paying a percentage of each transaction to the bank? This can be costly for retailers. Additionally, tipping may not be popular in some countries, which could show a lack of respect towards vendors. Finally, offering cash as a payment option is considered a value-added service, which increases the likelihood of customers returning to the store."}
{"2242": "\n\nRevised: It is important to note the HMRC rule, which states that a person becomes entitled to payment of earnings on a specific date.

For example, an employee may be entitled to a bonus for the year ending 31 December 2004, payable on 30 June 2005 only if they are still employed on the specified date. In this case, the payment becomes due on 31 December 2004, but the employee will only receive it on 30 June 2005. As an employee, you do not need to worry about PAYE as it is your employer's responsibility to process it for you.

If there is no broker or the counterparty still refuses to pay, parties involved may sue for breach of contract, leading to legal consequences such as seizure of assets, enforced bankruptcy, and imprisonment. MD-Tech reiterates that even governments who refuse to pay derivatives losses (like Argentina did in the early 20th century) may suffer the consequences such as a fall in credit ratings, loss of reputation, and bankruptcy. Finally, MD-Tech explains that netting off is a process where all parties' cash flows are used to pay each other off, resulting in reflecting only net changes in account balances."}

Also, unfortunately, none of these programs offer a simple and generous option of deducting the entire tuition fees without any limits. Moreover, one must be cautious while using multiple credits or deductions in a given tax year. Nevertheless, Chapter 12, \"Business Deduction for Work-Related Education,\" is worth paying special attention to. This program enables you to deduct transportation expenses, which is not provided by other programs. However, there are specific restrictions to consider.

Shorting comes with rules, including margin requirements, to mitigate the risk of a margin call resulting from a security's unexpected price increase. If a bond sells at $960 currently and can be repurchased later for $952.38, the difference can be gained. It's worth considering how other bonds are performing price-wise over time.

However, having a poor credit score may limit your access to credit and increase the likelihood that you will file small claims, which ultimately hurts the company's bottom line. For instance, if you only have $750 in damages and a $500 deductible, it may not be worth filing a claim to receive just $250, especially if you have access to cash or credit for repairs. \n\nIf you fear that canceling your credit card accounts will negatively impact your credit, the answer is simple: don't close them. Unless you need to sever ties with a co-owner or want to avoid paying an annual fee, there is no benefit in closing a revolving credit account. In fact, if you struggle to keep spending under control, it might be best to shred the card. If the account remains inactive for a while, the credit card provider may eventually cancel it with minimal impact on your credit. However, if you carry significant balances on other cards, your credit utilization ratio will increase, which could have negative consequences."}
{"2250": "\n\nIn the United States, stocks are typically listed on one exchange but can be traded on multiple venues. It is important to confirm what the data is indicating, specifically whether it is showing trades on the primary-listed exchange, or trades made at any venue. It is also important to consider trade condition codes, as only certain codes contribute to the day's open/high/low/close values, while others only contribute to volume data. The Consolidated Tape Association provides clear guidelines on which trades should be included in each value, though some vendors may have their own interpretation or make errors in interpreting specifications. Surprisingly, the majority of trading volume for many stocks occurs outside their primary-listed exchange. For example, on March 2nd, 2015, NASDAQ:AAPL traded a total volume of 48,096,663 shares across all venues, while trading on NASDAQ itself accounted for only 12,050,277 shares. It is also important to note that trades can be cancelled, which some data vendors may not reflect in their data. Furthermore, some vendors may \"snapshot\" their feed at a specific time, causing data discrepancies if subsequent data is missed. Finally, some vendors may round prices/volumes, which may result in comparing two different sets of trades with their own specific inclusion rules against the same stock.

However, if you know the transaction went through and there were inadequate funds in your account, you have options. If your bank automatically charges insufficient fund fees to a separate account, then you need not worry. If not, most banks offer a grace period until the end of the day to clear your account by paying the overdraft amount and bringing your balance to at least zero.

However, it is important to note that this is not a requirement. The larger and more corporate the lender, the less likely you are to receive this type of support. Your ability to work out a repayment plan for missed payments will depend on the length of your reduced income. If you are experiencing a temporary period of unemployment and will be able to pay again in a few months, you may be able to create a repayment plan for some of your debts. However, if your income will be permanently reduced, or the duration of your income reduction is too long, filing for bankruptcy may be necessary in order to save your home and vehicle. It is important to research your area and seek out debt counseling services for guidance on when bankruptcy is advisable. When looking for a counselor, make sure that you find a local nonprofit organization rather than a predatory lender disguised as a credit counseling service. Some of these frauds take any money you pay, divide it among your creditors and allow your late or partial payment fees to continue accruing, while charging you a fee on top. This is fraudulent and may even result in criminal charges. The key is to communicate openly with your lenders, providing them with the level of disclosure they need to know.

{"2271": "\n\nHere's how capital gains work: they can be either long-term or short-term, depending on how long the taxpayer holds the property. If held for a year or less, the gain or loss is short-term. If the taxpayer's long-term gains exceed their long-term losses, the difference is a net long-term capital gain. The taxpayer has a net capital gain if the net long-term capital gain is greater than the net short-term capital loss. Short-term gains are taxed separately at a higher rate. To avoid realizing a long-term capital gain but still trade the stock, one can wait until the next year. Either the stock will decline, resulting in short-term gains on the short, or it will rise, resulting in short-term losses on the short that offset the gains on the stock.

Each year, she provided the necessary information from a provided checklist, and it appeared to me that a clerk then input the details into tax software. When I took over from her previous preparer, I requested a brief consultation from him. Although he was a very pleasant person, I discovered that she could have utilized a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) and donated directly from her IRA to save on taxes. As she was over 70 \u00bd years old and kept the standard deduction, this would have saved her $500. Additionally, she was in the 15% bracket, and there was still space for a Roth conversion to avoid the 25% bracket as her required minimum distributions (RMDs) increased over time. However, the previous preparer was not a financial planner and was unable to advise on these matters.

{"2287": "\n\nMichael Pryor's response accurately addresses the question asked. In contrast, the current accepted answer from Dheer provides a general overview of the entities involved in a typical transaction, but with some incorrect terminology. Below is a corrected and improved explanation: \n\nThe issuing bank is the organization that provides the customer with the credit card. When it comes to the split of service fees, the issuer takes on the majority of the cut that the merchant pays to different entities. For example, on an overall 2.5% service fee, approximately 1.5% goes to the issuer, 0.3% goes to the card network (such as Visa or Mastercard), and the remaining 0.7% goes to the acquiring bank. \n\nReward programs partner with participating merchants who pay a higher service fee in exchange for driving a higher volume of transactions to the merchant. A portion of the rewards also come from the issuer, who shares a percentage of their fee back to the customer in exchange for the likelihood of making more profit through increased transaction volume. For instance, a reward program might charge merchants a 4.5% fee, with the issuer receiving 3.5%, and up to 3% of this amount given back to the customer as a reward for loyalty. Banks can afford to take as little as 0.5% instead of their regular 1.5% due to increased transaction volume and the fixed membership fee they collect. It is worth noting that Costco has a similar business plan, but they generate all of their income from membership fees. By having enough clients, banks can theoretically run their entire program on membership fees alone, without any additional service fees to merchants. \n\nThe service fee mentioned above is arbitrary and can be lowered if the merchant is also a client of the issuing bank, meaning that both the issuing and acquiring banks are the same organization. This situation leads to a win-win-win situation for all parties involved. The banks stand to make more income if the customer ends up paying interest for their credit, although the rewards program is not designed to account for this."}

{"2290": "\n\nThe payment option known as \"Credit card installments\" or \"Equal pay installments\" is not widely used in the United States. While this option is supported directly by banks in other countries, it can only be found in select big stores such as home improvement stores, car dealerships, and cell phone operators in the US. Some stores may offer 0% financing for a certain period, but it is not the same as installments. Splitting payments into parts means that the seller receives payment in parts as well, which increases the risk of customer default and introduces the possibility of debt collection. Merchants usually support this payment option as banks do not care about it. In other countries, banks work directly with merchants, taking over or dividing the risk, but this is not the case in the United States. SplitIt is a company that allows stores to automate installments if they choose to do so. To build credit history in the US, obtaining a regular credit card may be difficult because there is no credit history. The easiest way is to request a \"secured credit card,\" where one must deposit funds upfront equal to the credit limit. This is a \"practice credit card\" that one uses for 6-12 months while the bank reports their usage to credit bureaus, establishing their credit score. One can then get their deposit back and convert their secured card into a regular credit card. One can also build credit history by paying rent and utilities, but very few companies report these payments to credit bureaus. Some businesses help to solve this problem for a fee."}

{"2292": "\n\nAssuming you have no debts, it may be wise to consider investing the money in property. Looking at property prices over the past two decades, it is clear that returns can be very good. For instance, I purchased a house in 1998 and sold it in 2003 for about 110% of the purchase price. However, it should be noted that past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Despite this, investing in property is a low-risk option because property prices are currently rising, and it is always best to get your foot on the housing ladder as soon as possible because prices can quickly become unaffordable even for those with good income levels. Moreover, a rental income from a property can be very useful without tying you down too much. For instance, you can purchase a reasonable property in several parts of the UK for \u00a360k that will generate a rental income of \u00a3400-\u00a3500. It is, however, important to note that a rental property needs to be maintained properly to protect your investment, and you will need to have a tenant. While it may be challenging to judge the right time to sell and purchase property with property prices, it is still a wise investment option.\n\nIf you decide to keep the Trust Fund, I would recommend comparing it with other options because a 12% return over six years is not great, even though the stock market has been slow.

Many investors may perceive Greek bonds as more than 5% risky, and therefore opt for less risky alternatives. As a result, lenders would expect a higher return, say 7%, as compensation for the additional risk of default. Governments would prefer not to issue bonds at all, but may have little choice when alternative measures like printing more money raise concerns of their own.

{"2297": "\n\nThe assumption that houses appreciate in value by 5% annually is unrealistic. Real house prices have remained relatively constant over the long term. However, this applies to the market as a whole and not necessarily to individual houses, unless they are well-maintained. Investing in a single house is not well-diversified and comes with the risk of unforeseen problems such as mold, which could result in significant losses. In contrast, a carefully diversified stock portfolio carries lower risk, though individual stocks can also experience similar problems. For this reason, I would demand a higher nominal return of 10% from an individual house investment compared to an 8% nominal return from a non-leveraged stock portfolio.\n\nIf the goal is to diversify real estate investments, a portfolio of diversified real estate investments is a safer option than a diversified stock portfolio, with a nominal return of 6% over the long term being appropriate.

In reality, the real return from buying a house comes from not having to pay rent, not from expected price appreciation.

{"2308": "\n\nThe price of a stock is established by an agreement between buyers and sellers. Companies do not determine the price of their own stocks; instead, investors set the price through each trade. The latest trade price is the only available price, as there is no \"official\" one. With a limit order, it is possible to propose a trade at any price, but finding a willing counterparty may be challenging. Stock quotes obtained from brokers or financial websites reflect the last traded price, which may update at varying speeds depending on the provider. Obtaining real-time quotes is possible through various means. Rather than relying on an \"official\" price, it is more helpful to consider the bid/ask spread. For further information on this, refer to this question."}

The new broker is usually very motivated to assist with this process as acquiring your assets would be in their best interest."}
{"2310": "\n\nAre all bonds priced to provide the same average return after accounting for risk? In other words, do risk premiums only compensate for potential losses? The answer is no. For example, General Electric may issue a bond with a lower yield than a Chinese company with no prior track record in the U.S. markets. Bond pricing factors in default risk, servicability of the bond, location of the issuer's main business, and specific terms and conditions stated in the prospectus (such as whether the bond is callable, insured against default, etc.). Why would anyone take on more risk for the same payoff? The reward for higher risk (default risk, term structure, coupon payments, etc.) is greater to compensate for the increased risk exposure. As a result, the yield on a high-risk bond will always be higher than that on a low-risk bond. For example, the yield on Greek bonds in 2011-2012 was in the 25-30% range to reflect the high risk of a Greek default. Those hedge funds that bought Greek bonds during the eurozone crisis made a fortune. The risk-return relationship for bonds or a portfolio of bonds applies to the Efficient Frontier theory. To put it simply: you always want to be compensated for the risk you're taking. So while investors may view a bond purchase as risk-free, that assumption is not always correct."}
{"2311": "\n\nA $260k mortgage may be difficult to manage with a salary of only $80k. If you tend to have expensive tastes, you may need to consider scaling down your lifestyle. The determining factor for your financial well-being will be the taxes and recurring fees associated with owning the property. In the event that property taxes in your area are increasing at a higher rate than inflation, you could experience trouble in the future. It is important to consider local market conditions, as these will play a large role in your decision. As someone unfamiliar with Salt Lake City, it is difficult for me to offer specific guidance. However, it is generally true that condos tend to decrease in value faster than single-family homes during tough economic times. If the condo you are considering is located in a desirable area, and the building is well-maintained, there is a good chance that its value will appreciate in the future. Ultimately, if you believe the property is a good investment, then go for it."}

Nevertheless, as long as you or your spouse reported all of the income earned, there should be no issues. The income should have been reported either on Schedule C or as miscellaneous income on line 21, with Schedule C being the appropriate option if your spouse is in the cleaning business.

The low to non-existent taxes are another benefit. Although recent changes have been made, Switzerland is still seen as a destination for individuals trying to safeguard their assets in the event of a country's financial collapse or war. This can cause the CHF to appreciate. Conversely, Japan is unique because of its persistent near-zero inflation, leading to low nominal and real interest rates. The \"cash and carry\" or \"carry\" trade prevails, with investors borrowing in JPY to buy assets in other currencies. If those countries are at risk of confiscating their resident's money or engaging in war, carry traders will unwind their leveraged investments, increasing the demand for JPY and driving its value up."}

According to E*TRADE's website, equity options that are $0.01 or more in the money will be automatically exercised for you, unless you instruct them not to do so. Otherwise, options that expire out of the money will be worthless. You may request to exercise American style options before expiration, but only on the last trading day prior to expiration. A broker-assisted trade will be necessary to exercise the option, and the regular options commission applies.

When a bank is designated as the Clearing Bank for RMB business, it means that all RMB transactions must be cleared through that particular bank. For example, if Bank A in Hong Kong receives a check drawn on Bank B in Hong Kong in RMB, Bank A must go to the Bank of China (BoC) with the check to obtain the funds. The BoC will then deduct the money from Bank B's account. This process requires that both Bank A and Bank B have accounts with the BoC. A \"sole\" clearing house means that there is only one designated bank for these transactions. This means that Bank A and Bank B cannot settle the check through another bank such as C, even if they both have accounts with them. Instead, they MUST utilize the services of the BoC."}

The potential downside is minimal, as it is similar to any stock investment that may decrease in value. It is important to only sell puts on stocks that you would be comfortable owning outright. For those who disagree with this strategy, I would appreciate further clarification as to why they hold this view. While there are risks involved, selling puts is not inherently worse than investing in stocks or dividend stocks. Since the majority of options expire without being exercised, the odds are generally favorable when selling puts."}

Therefore, it's likely that he will end up filing just to demonstrate that he doesn't have to. Ultimately, if he receives 1099 income or any other income reported to the IRS that brings him over the filing threshold, he should file a return."}
{"2320": "\n\nWhen purchasing investment properties, there are varying degrees of passive investment involvement. On one end, there are individuals who purchase investment properties and hand them over to real estate agents for management, without wanting to think about it thereafter (except for receiving rent payments regularly). On the other end, there are those who engage in all aspects of management, including collecting rent by knocking on the doors of their tenants. Ideally, a balanced approach is preferred, where successful property investors operate their investment properties like a business. They handle overall management of the properties but delegate day-to-day details to a team. \n\nIn terms of property age, brand new properties will command a premium price, while those that are five to ten years old will be relatively new but without the added cost. I once purchased a two to three-year-old unit for less than its original purchase price when brand new. Additionally, even with properties that are five years old, the majority of depreciation benefits remain available. Maintenance expectations should also not be too high for properties that are five to ten years old. \n\nAnother option to consider is Defence Housing, managed by the Department of Defence, which offers guaranteed rent for ten years or more, with or without tenants. They are also responsible for maintenance and restoring properties to their original state when their contract is over. However, management fees for these properties can be high, up to 15% or more. While it may not be suitable for everyone, those considering a passive investment approach may find this a viable option. Personally, I do not endorse Defence Housing properties due to their high fees and terms and conditions, but it is worth considering based on individual circumstances."}
{"2321": "\n\nRounding errors may occur, but if the actual tax paid does not change, there is typically no reason to file an amendment. As long as all income was reported appropriately and the tax was calculated correctly, rounding up or down on individual lines is insignificant. However, it is useful to remember that while federal taxes are typically rounded to the nearest dollar on each form line, this may not be true for state taxes. It is best to avoid calculating cents and instead round to the nearest dollar, maintaining consistency across all tax forms. Although reporting cents is legal, automatic tax filing software always rounds, so using this method will avoid any discrepancies."}
{"2322": "\n\nIf you are considering building a home, hiring a builder to work on a lot with utilities already connected can simplify the process. However, if you plan to subdivide a large piece of land, there are additional factors to consider. For instance, what easements exist and what easements would need to be created to connect utilities? Would all lots have street access, or would you need to dedicate part of the land for building a new road? Additionally, it is important to note that the value of the homes you build can be affected by the size of the parcels, which should ideally be closer to 1 acre to avoid diminishing their worth. Therefore, before proceeding, it is recommended to run the numbers with around 6 houses and to look for updated prices on the cost of building custom homes, which are typically around $275-$350, especially if working with an architect to create the plans."}

They may use their voting power to improve the value of undervalued stocks, or they may resort to more questionable practices like artificially inflating stock prices for short-term gain, resulting in market volatility.

However, in certain states, if you trade in your 14k car for another 14k car, you can receive a tax break. If you trade in your car for 7k, you will then owe tax on the remaining amount. If you only have 7k, it would be difficult to pay for both the new car and tax.

Tax brackets apply to all individuals and as you earn more and move up in brackets, you are taxed at a higher rate for the additional income. Personal expenses can be deducted, but since most people do not keep detailed records of their expenses, blanket deduction amounts are used instead. Companies have detailed systems in place to track and categorize expenses, which makes it easier to tax on net profit.

My friend is currently doing an MBA project on the funding models of these organizations in the absence of mandatory licensing. The ACS is designated as the professional assessing authority for individuals seeking to apply for skilled migration as IT professionals to Australia. The ACS makes money by assisting the Australian government in determining immigration eligibility. For example, you would need to have your skills assessed by the ACS before even applying for immigration. The PASA (General) application costs AUD 400 (~ \u00a3225).\n\nBear in mind that there will be other fees involved. For instance, the government recommends using a registered migration agent, which can cost you anywhere from AUD 1500 to AUD 4000 (~ \u00a3850 - ~ \u00a32270). You will also need to pay a fee for the immigration application process itself, which currently totals AUD 6035 (~ \u00a33420) for professionals and other skilled migrants outside Australia. Therefore, it's prudent to have ample savings for all the red tape stuff and other expenses involved in moving to and living in Australia. Best of luck! By the way, have you considered Canada? ;)"}

Within a 10-mile radius of my home, there are 80 such companies, while over 100 operate throughout my county. To narrow down your options, consider established businesses in your local region or on a national level. You may also wish to start with your current lender. It is understandable to be concerned about possible scams or tricks. In the recent past, the most common scams involved teaser rates and risky loans, such as interest-only or pick-your-payment loans. Therefore, a straightforward loan package with minimal bells and whistles may be the best option to mitigate your risk. While it may be helpful to consult with organizations such as the Better Business Bureau or your neighbors, remember that even those who once loved their exotic mortgages could end up regretting their decision. Moreover, the quality of loan officers can vary significantly, even within well-established companies. Unless you can receive a personal recommendation for a specific loan officer, it is difficult to predict the level of service you will receive. The greatest risk associated with acquiring a mortgage for a purchase is the possibility of taking out a loan that leads to unaffordable monthly payments. However, this risk is somewhat lessened with a refinance, as you already have a mortgage with a known monthly payment. Keep in mind, though, that stretching out payments for another 30 years can lead to longer-term costs. Before refinancing, ensure that you understand your end goal and whether the streamlined options will meet your needs since they cannot be used to get cash out."}
{"2343": "\n\nSimilar bonds, including securitized mortgages, with comparable average lifetimes, typically have similar yields or trade within predictable yield spreads. However, despite having a 30-year lifetime, 30-year mortgages do not trade in synchronization with 30-year treasuries. In mortgage securitization, the federal agencies, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae bundle mortgages together for investors. Prepayment assumptions for these mortgages determine their average lifetimes, which are typically similar to 10-year treasury notes. For instance, the 100% PSA is the average prepayment rate, which increases linearly from zero to 6% over the initial 30 months of the mortgage. Subsequently, the prepayment rate is pegged at 6% per annum. Although prepayment rates for mortgage reduce their average lifetime, mortgage investments still yield returns that remain in step with 10-year Treasury notes. The average life of a debt relates to the expected time it takes to pay down the principal through sinking fund payments or amortization. To compute the average life, the payment date (in months or years fraction) is multiplied by its corresponding percentage of the total principal repaid, then adding them. The sum is then divided by the total issue size."}

While old advice encouraged individuals to purchase the largest home they could afford or opt for a \"starter home,\" those guidelines may no longer be appropriate in the current market. \n\nAs a general rule, you can estimate the maximum mortgage payment to be rule of 28, which means that your monthly mortgage payment should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income before taxes are taken out. The maximum housing cost is determined by the rule of 32; your total housing payments that include homeowner's insurance, private mortgage insurance, property taxes, and association fees should not exceed 32% of your gross monthly income. Finally, the rule of 40 can be used to ensure that your total debt payments, including your housing payment, auto loan or student loan payments, and minimum credit card payments, do not exceed 40% of your gross monthly income. \n\nRemember that these are all estimates based on lender guidelines and should be used only as a starting point. The final loan amount that you qualify for will depend on interest rates, mortgage duration, and how much you can afford to withdraw from your savings. Moreover, keep in mind that if you can't provide 20% of the home's value in cash, you will be required to pay PMI. \n\nLastly, it's essential to note that purchasing a home may not be financially viable unless you plan on staying put for more than five years. Renting may be cheaper, depending on the local housing options, and it doesn't come with the added expenses and responsibilities that come along with home ownership. Buy a home only if it makes sense financially and if it meets your quality-of-life needs, not merely as an investment opportunity."}

It's possible to combine non-tax-advantaged accounts and allocate a portion for emergency funds. SPY is an ETF version of SPDR, an index mutual fund that tracks the S&P 500 index by buying weighted amounts of its members using algorithms. Investors have little to no direct influence on the index. Targeted retirement plan funds offer a diversified allocation in one fund but watch out for high fees. If your company is matching 10% of your income on a 1:1 basis, it's an excellent offer even with a 10-year vesting requirement. However, a 1:10 match for 401k contributions is a terrible deal.

If you transfer funds to a Roth IRA, be aware that you'll need to pay taxes on the amount you roll over (unless you're transferring from a Roth 401k). However, any money in the Roth will grow tax-free and remain tax-free upon withdrawal. On the other hand, a traditional IRA doesn't require taxes upfront but will when you make withdrawals. Keep in mind that withdrawals cannot be made until you're at least 59 1/2 years of age without facing penalties, the same as with a 401k plan. Additionally, if you decide to take the money out (for a mortgage, another investment, etc.) without transferring it to a qualified account, you'll owe taxes as well as a 10% penalty.

{"2371": "\n\nRevised: Trading based solely on newly released news may not be the most effective strategy, as the market has often already factored in the news during the anticipation phase. Additionally, the market response can be unpredictable, where good news may lead to a decline in share prices and vice versa. For instance, the announcement of new record profits may lead to a drop in stock prices, if that growth doesn't meet analysts' high expectations or projections. On the other hand, a company may report losses but experience a rise in share price if the reported loss is less than the expected loss. For example, if a company was expected to make a 50% loss but only reported a 20% loss, the stock price can go up, especially if the shares had been performing poorly for some time. Similarly, when the Federal Reserve in the USA announces an interest rate hike, it can have either a positive or negative effect on the market, depending on expectations and whether it indicates an economic improvement. \n\nThe best trading approach is to develop a well-defined trading plan and use technical analysis with established buy and sell criteria that you follow rigorously. Then, back-test the trading plan under different market conditions to ensure that you have a positive expectancy."}

{"2373": "After reading from O'Neil to Van Tharp, it seems that no one can consistently pick winners more than 75% of the time regardless of their trading system. Most traders see success if they have a 60% win and 40% loss ratio. The chart is only a reflection of the past and therefore cannot predict the future reliably. To illustrate this, imagine looking at a daily chart at 9:30 am and trying to determine the market direction for the next hour based on technical indicators and fundamentals. It would be virtually impossible, and anyone attempting it would quickly realize that predicting hourly or even minute-by-minute price movements is foolish. While larger patterns of behavior over a period of years can be relied upon, attempting to predict short-term movements is futile.\n\nTo be a successful trader, it's important to keep trading and cut your losses to no more than 1% of your portfolio risk per trade. By doing this and aiming for at least a 50/50 win-loss ratio, you will eventually end up with a profitable portfolio. Even the best traders are only right 60% of the time, so the key is to keep trading and cutting losses while holding onto winning positions. One effective strategy is to trade 3x leveraged funds or stocks with a beta of at least 3 from the general index. The stock market trends, with stock movements following a 66-75% up or down trend pattern. Therefore, if you buy when a stock is up, there's a good chance it will go up the following day as well.\n\nRemember that losing 1/3 of the time is part of the unpredictable nature of the stock market, caused by the fact that three types of traders (day traders, swing traders, and buy and hold investors) are all trading the same stock at the same time with different price targets and time horizons. It's impossible to predict price action or volume in this scenario, but by cutting losses and riding winners consistently, you can achieve a good return on investment."}

Comparing a Roth investment with a Traditional investment is a separate topic that could easily cause confusion. If deducting a traditional IRA is not feasible, then Cramer's advice may not be as straightforward when it comes to a Traditional 401(k). This means that Cramer's advice may not apply to most people since they have a Traditional 401(k), and if you are enrolled in a 401(k), you can only deduct a Traditional IRA if your income is very low.

In contrast, the efficient market theory argues that a stock's price accurately reflects its underlying value, as championed by Harry Markowitz and Eugene Fama. While most investors believe that markets are not perfectly efficient, Benjamin Graham's statement that \"the market is a voting machine in the short run, but a weighing machine in the long run\" suggests that short-term price changes are influenced by public sentiment, while long-term changes are based on the stock's actual worth. \n\nFor instance, current hype around tech stocks is driving up the share price of LinkedIn despite its modest earnings relative to valuation.

As a W-2 employee, a portion of your paycheck was withheld for income, social security, and Medicare taxes. However, just because you did not receive that portion of your earnings does not mean that it was immediately sent to the IRS. Some companies only send in withheld taxes quarterly, which provides them with a short-term, interest-free loan. Taxes withheld by a W-2 employee in the later months of the year may not be provided to the IRS until 15 January of the following year. Although a W-2 employee earning $100K will most likely pay less in taxes than someone who is self-employed with $5K in expenses, there are many factors to consider.

It is important to note that tax laws can change, and there may be unexpected surcharges. The notion of a \"social security lockbox\" and the Medicare and social security taxes were created to make the actual income tax rate more palatable, and all tax contributions go into one big bucket of money.

{"2388": "Firstly, it is not recommended to ask a realtor for advice as they represent the seller. Blankip's advice, as mentioned earlier, is the most accurate. To estimate the market, analyze past sales in the neighborhood and estimate the prospects for the house at different durations. Determine the house's expected sales time if it is priced high, the seller is willing to wait. Understand the owner's profile, their timetable, and objectively rate the plusses and minuses of the house to determine the lowest price the owner will accept in a 30-day timeframe. Make a written offer with an address and email, no phone number. Ignore counter offers or conversations with realtors. If the 30-day time frame elapses, move onto the next choice and make a more aggressive offer. This approach may seem counter-intuitive, but it is the pro way to negotiate and will lead to the best results for a short-term situation. For long-term situations, such as for an investor, a different strategy can be used, which involves pressuring a vulnerable seller. Building a relationship with the seller by pestering them every two weeks can result in a much better deal, but it takes more time and effort."}

For example, my home insurance costs $50 a month, but if my house were to burn down, I could face a loss of $100,000. The likelihood of that happening is minimal, but I'd rather pay the $50 monthly premium and not have to worry about it.\n\nIn another example, when I purchased a filing cabinet for $160, the store offered me an extended warranty for $20 a year. Although the probability of something happening to damage the cabinet is small, I could handle the loss of $160 if it did occur. I wouldn't lose sleep over it. However, losing $100,000 or becoming homeless would certainly keep me up at night.\n\nWhen I was younger and had less money, I bought cheaper cars knowing that if they were totaled, I could find a way to buy another. In that case, it wasn't worth paying for car insurance. Now that I drive a car that costs $6,000, I have collision and comprehensive coverage, but it's still debatable whether it's necessary. I paid cash for the car, and if needed, I could come up with the money to replace it. Plus, my last college tuition payment is due next month, so that expense is disappearing. :-)"}
{"2397": "\n\nBased on my understanding, paying your bills more than 5 days late will not result in bankruptcy or hinder your ability to obtain future loans. However, it can potentially result in lenders offering you credit at a higher interest rate, which may not be helpful if you are already struggling with finances. Regardless of your financial situation, there are things you can do to improve it.\n\nThe first thing you should do is set a budget by listing all sources of income and expenses, including bills and discretionary spending. You can talk with your existing lenders to negotiate reducing your interest rates on debts and repayments. However, note that any reduction in repayments may lengthen your repayment period and increase your total interest in the long term.\n\nTo increase your income and reduce expenses, consider getting a job, selling unwanted items or starting a small home business. You can also make coffee and lunch at home instead of purchasing them, pay off high-interest debts first, consolidate all debts into a lower interest rate loan, reduce discretionary spending, and cancel unnecessary services.\n\nDebt consolidation into a lower interest rate loan can be a good idea, but be wary of longer terms that may result in paying more interest in the long run. Use caution when exploring debt consolidation options and read the fine print carefully.\n\nIf you find that repayments are getting out of hand and no one will help with debt consolidation or reducing interest rates, consider a Part 9 debt agreement as a last resort. Remember, a debt agreement will appear on your credit file for seven years, and your name will be listed on the National Personal Insolvency Index forever.\n\nIf you need further assistance or information on managing your finances, contact Centrelink's Financial Information Service for free and confidential education and information on financial and lifestyle issues.

{"2400": "\n\nIf my salary slip states that I will be paying x INR tax this financial year, what is the minimum investment I need to make to avoid paying any tax? It's important to note that the rebate of up to Rs 5000 is not directly linked to investments. If your total Gross is less than Rs 5 lacs, you can claim this rebate from the total tax computed. However, whether or not your salary slip considers this rebate amount will depend on your company's policy. Some companies may have already factored in the rebate and deducted less tax, while others may not have. Regardless, it's important to claim this rebate when you file your returns, as failing to do so will result in excess tax. Unfortunately, there is no provision in the company form 16 to show this rebate. Furthermore, if your taxable income exceeds Rs 5 lacs due to other income, you will not be eligible for this rebate and will have to pay tax. To claim this rebate, you must explicitly specify this claim under 87A in your ITR. If your company has already factored in the rebate while deducting tax, you will not receive any refunds, while if they haven't, you will have to claim the refund. If x is not calculated by considering this rebate amount, the increment of tax rebate from INR 2000 to INR 5000 will be applicable immediately. For instance, if your gross salary is INR 6 lacs, but you invest INR 1.5 lacs in 80C, your net taxable income will be INR 4.5 lacs. The tax on 4.5 lacs by a normal individual less than 60 years will be 10% of 2 lacs, i.e., INR 20,000. You can then claim the INR 5000 deduction under 87A and pay only INR 15,000 [20000-15000]. Whereas, if your gross salary is INR 2.8 lacs and you haven't made any investments, your net taxable income will be INR 2.8 lacs, and the tax would be INR 3000, which you can claim the rebate under 87A and not pay tax."}

However, if you invested that same $1000 instead, would you earn more than $2000 over the same period? While it's difficult to determine, you can make some informed guesses by comparing potential returns from CD or treasury bonds or by looking at the average returns of an index fund over a 5 - 10 year period. \n\nAs an illustration of this opportunity cost, suppose you have a $200,000 loan at 0.25% per year, which results in $500 in savings.

In the case of currency futures, the volatility of major currencies is generally low, which allows traders to get away with a few percentage points. For commodities, the margin can get as high as 10%, while single equities frequently require margin of around 20%. Indices, on the other hand, require margin of around 10%.

Conversely, if the earnings decrease but the price remains the same, you're now paying the same price for less earnings. \n\nConsidering this, when earnings increase, and the price of the stock stays the same, the stock becomes relatively cheaper because you're now getting more earnings for the same price. However, all else equal, one would expect the price of the stock to increase in proportion to the earnings growth. Therefore, if a stock's P/E ratio is growing faster than its earnings, it is becoming more expensive because you're paying more per cent of earnings. On the other hand, if the P/E ratio is growing more slowly than earnings, it's becoming cheaper because you're paying less per cent of earnings. \n\nLastly, if a stock's P/E ratio is growing at the same rate as its earnings, its relative valuation remains the same. Although the actual price of the stock may increase, you're still paying the same amount for each cent of the underlying company's earnings."}

{"2426": "I am a Finance major from Finland, and this is how it works here: \nWhen you lend money to a company, it acquires an asset and liability despite no income. The company then uses the borrowed money to pay its bills, leading to expenses that accumulate until the end of the accounting period when they are recorded. These expenses are then paid out of the gained asset and do not affect the liability. If the company makes a profit, it becomes taxable; however, this taxable amount is deducted from the tax reserve accumulated over the past ten years of losses. When the company repays the loan, it is split into two parts: principal and interest. The principal payment reduces the company's liability, and there are no tax implications, but the interest payment reduces taxes. The loan's impact on an individual's finances only occurs when the interest payment is received, which is taxable income. As long as proper documentation is maintained throughout the loan's duration, repaying it should not pose any issues."}

A few states in the US have strict income tax policies; for instance, owning real estate in New York makes all your income taxable in that state. Unfortunately, there's no overarching US regulation; each state determines who qualifies as a resident and how taxes apply. In some cases, you may be considered a resident of multiple states and owe income taxes in each.

Oklahoma, for instance, considers you a resident until you establish residency elsewhere, as @Jay's answer noted."}
{"2428": "\n\nInflation can be a misleading economic indicator because it is based on the change in prices of only essential goods rather than everything in the economy. Furthermore, it is influenced by various factors, such as the supply of money, the number of goods exchanged, and the supply of credit. This means that rising prices may not necessarily indicate an actual shortage, as it could be due to monetary expansion. For example, the total money supply in the USA has doubled every decade since the 1970s, which means that even with low inflation, cash holdings are losing value due to the increased money supply. \n\nWhile inflation does not factor in shares, the majority of the increased money supply is going into the stock market, which causes the value of individual cash holdings to decrease. Hence, while the inflation rate may not change, the reduced value of money is evident when the quantity of shares that can be purchased now is compared to the past. The credit supply is another factor that can influence the price level, making it a wildcard in the mix."}
{"2429": "\n\nVictor, while the drop in price may seem to cancel out the dividend at first, there are other factors that come into play. Dividends are not pointless, as proven by the following example: Let's say we have two identical stocks, but only one pays a 2% annual dividend quarterly. At the end of the year, the dividend stock would be expected to have a share price 2% lower than the non-dividend stock. However, an equal investment in both would yield the same amount of money. In the real market, an analysis comparing Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (VOO) closing price to the S&P 500 Index closing price from September 9, 2010 to 2014 shows that, despite paying a quarterly dividend of about 2% a year, VOO's share price actually grew more than the S&P each year except for 2012 to 2013. Over the entire 4-year period, the VOO share price grew 80.3987% compared to S&P's growth of 80.083%, a difference of 1/3 of 1% in favor of VOO. Although VOO drops about 1/2% relative to S&P on every ex date, it still manages to make it up. This data suggests that dividends can actually be considered free money, since other factors such as supply and demand also affect VOO's performance.

Points paid on an original mortgage are deductible as mortgage interest in the year paid, while points paid on a refinance must be amortized over the life of the loan. This means the mortgage interest deduction is the sum of the interest paid in the monthly payments plus a fraction of the points paid for the refinance. The undeducted portion of the points is deducted when the mortgage is paid off early or refinanced again. Prepayment penalties are also deductible as mortgage interest in the year of the prepayment."}

To continue trading, you need to maintain a minimum of 30% in your account. So, for instance, if you short $10,000, you must have at least $3,000 in your account. Suppose you have $5,000 in cash. In that case, you may short $10,000 worth of securities, such as 100 shares of xyz at $100 per share. It is unlikely that you will receive a margin call until your account balance dips to $3,000, which may happen when xyz climbs to $120 per share.

This could potentially increase your credit utilization, which is the percentage of your total available credit that you use at any given time. As your total available credit decreases and the amount of credit you use stays the same, your utilization rate will increase. Ideally, individuals in the United States want to maintain a utilization rate between 8% to 30%. Therefore, if this change increases your utilization rate, it could harm your credit score. However, if your utilization rate is currently low, it may not be impacted negatively. Although the rules in the United Kingdom may differ, a utilization rate of 22% is acceptable, assuming you have no other debt. A utilization rate of 17% or lower may be more favorable.

For online transactions that require the delivery of goods, companies are expected to start with an Authorization, which signals the bank to mark the funds but not transfer them. Once the company ships the goods, they send a Capture command to transfer the funds. There may be a time delay of up to 3 days or longer.\n\nThe Sale method is typically used for online transactions where the service is delivered immediately or for point of sale transactions made in person at a store. This method combines both Authorization and Capture into a single step.\n\nHowever, not all systems have the same requirements, and it is common for people playing online games to accidentally authorize funds to be transferred from their bank. Processing refunds can be expensive, so companies may choose to only perform an Authorization and never issue a Capture. This means it's as if the transaction never occurred, and the costs to the company are much lower.\n\nIn cases of suspected fraud or unauthorized transactions, it would be in the company's interest to authorize the transaction, apply the credits to the account, and then wait a few days before capturing the funds from the bank. Depending on the wait time, the bank may have rolled back the authorization.

Once we have obtained the amount required at the beginning of retirement, we can use the following formula to determine the yearly contribution required to meet this goal: \"amount\" represents the previously calculated target amount, \"interest\" is the decimal form of yearly compounding interest and \"yearsSaving\" represents the number of years until the target amount needs to be reached.

The EDF Energy website provides a detailed explanation of these notes, indicating that they were issued to British Energy shareholders who chose to take them instead of 74 pence of cash per share held when EDF acquired British Energy in 2009. The Nuclear Power Notes are ten-year financial instruments (2009-2019) that provide the ex-British Energy shareholders with a continuous interest in the \"EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Fleet.\" These notes are traded on the ICAP Securities & Derivatives Exchange.\n\nThe calculation of whether any cash will be paid to Nuclear Power Note holders is carried out annually based on the nuclear output of the EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Fleet (\"Eligible Nuclear Output\") and market power prices (\"Power Prices\"). The figure for these calculations- MWh/TWh- indicates the energy output of the nuclear plants, which is the foundation of the Nuclear Power Notes value. \n\nHowever, there might be confusion about the relationship between this and the shareholders' payment.

{"2457": "\n\n\nI want to clarify that I am not an active investor in Australia, and therefore, you should seek advice and mentorship from other investors in your market. Nonetheless, since you are here, I can offer some generalized advice. When it comes to investing in real estate, there are two main rules of thumb to assess quickly whether the property is a worthy investment or not. These are the 50% rule and the 2% (or 1%) rule.\n\nThe 50% rule states that, in general, 50% of the income from the property will go towards expenses, not including debt service. For instance, if you are earning $1000 a month, $500 of that should go towards utilities, taxes, repairs, capital expenditures, advertising, lawn care, and other relevant expenses. This leaves $500 to pay the mortgage, and if there is any remaining amount, that can be considered cash flow. Since this is your first property, and it is situated in a \"relatively bad neighborhood,\" it would be advisable to increase the percentage to 60% to guarantee that you have some cushion.\n\nThe 1 or 2% rule states that the monthly rent should be 1 (or 2) percent of the purchase price. In your case, the house is bought for $150,000, so if it rents for $1,500 a month, it could be a good investment. However, if it rents for $3,000 a month, then it is probably an excellent investment. Other factors need to be considered as well - if a property meets the 2% rule, it could be in a rough neighborhood, which might increase turnover, the most significant expense in an investment property. If a property meets one or both of these rules, you should scrutinize it further and conduct proper due diligence to ascertain that it is a good deal. Note that these guidelines may have to be modified to suit your particular market. For instance, they may not hold true for most (or all) big cities."}

{"2461": "\n\nWhat are the benefits of this approach? When purchasing a house with a mortgage, the bank places a lien on the property, making it the collateral. Therefore, it is unclear why you would require additional or alternative collateral. Using the house as a down payment would necessitate giving it to the seller or selling it and giving them the funds. This option makes sense only if the house is entirely yours and you have no purpose for it after purchasing the second property. This is typically what people do when buying a new house, selling the old one, and using the money as a down payment on the new one. However, what would happen to the co-owner in this situation? Are they moving with you to the new property? The only feasible scenario would be to obtain a home equity loan against the initial property and utilize that as the down payment on the second property. This option might help you avoid the expense of mortgage insurance. If you decide to go with DanielAnderson's suggestion of a home equity loan, the bank would almost certainly require the signature of the co-owner. In the event of a loan default, the bank could seize and sell the house, providing the co-owner with a share of the money. A bank would be unlikely to pursue a scenario where they own half of the house but are forbidden from selling it without the co-owner's permission. They are typically not in the rental business. In the event of a default, the co-owner may be required to leave the property. I am uncertain who the co-owner is or the potential difficulties they may face.

{"2466": "\n\nThe annualized volatility over a twenty-year period should be about the same as over a five-year period because the volatility scales proportionally for independent and identically distributed returns. To annualize the volatility for any number of monthly returns T, setting the annualization factor m = 12 is required. However, it is essential to note that scaling volatility in this manner is mathematically correct only if the underlying price model is driven by Geometric Brownian motion. This implies that prices are log normally distributed, and returns are normally distributed. Nevertheless, it is a well-known fact that when long-term volatility is estimated without changing the model, volatility tends to be overestimated. \n\nFor example, a demonstration shows that when we model 12,000 monthly returns with a mean of 3% and a standard deviation of 2%, the annualized volatility should be Sqrt(12) * 2 = 6.9282. If we calculate the annualized volatility for return sequences of different lengths, we can see that there is an inaccuracy for shorter sequences. The five-year sequence average is closest to the theoretically expected figure (6.9282). As the commenter noted, volatility is slightly overestimated when scaled over long periods. \n\nRegarding reinvesting returns, it does not significantly affect the volatility. For instance, comparing the Dow Jones Industrial Average Capital Returns (CR) versus Net Returns (NR), the return differences are somewhat smoothed, typically 0.1% each month and 0.25% every third month. However, more erratic dividend reinvestment could increase the volatility."}

Secondly, provide details about the nature of the journey leading up to the accident, and explain why classifying it as \"commuting\" is inaccurate, unless it was part of a commute to work.

Additionally, what are the pros and cons of trading on exchanges directly versus indirectly through brokers for individual investors? While direct trading may save costs and expenses paid to brokers, registration with the exchange can incur costs and may be limited. Some exchanges have websites for electronic trading, like NASDAQ and BATS. Can all stocks be found and traded on every exchange? It's possible for more popular stocks to be listed on multiple exchanges, but smaller companies may only be listed on one. Do you have any advice for choosing brokerage companies or exchanges? As a beginner, a discount broker is a good choice, while sophisticated investors may opt for full-service brokers. Your bank may also have a brokerage firm.

{"2479": "\n\nFor the type of market neutrality you desire, which is free from crash risk, the best strategy is to use covered calls to hedge your shares when implied volatility is expensive, and puts when implied volatility is cheap, with nearest at the money expirations. It is important to note that relying solely on a put strategy can be very costly and should only be used with the longest-term options due to their high cost, which can reach many tens of percent per year. During a market crash, securities become almost perfectly correlated, which means that the market crash risk of one security is essentially equal to the market crash risk of the overall market. Therefore, hedging the security itself makes a position market neutral for crash risk. While this strategy will have intermittent opportunity cost risk in the form of slower returns during market expansion, it will pay for smaller losses during a crash. In the long run, this hedging strategy can lead to greater returns than the underlying's expected long run return with less volatility."}

{"2487": "\n\nIf your father is still capable of making financial decisions and signing contracts, there is a better option available. Consider having your father borrow against the equity of the home to finance the renovation. For instance, if the current value of the house is $400,000, he can borrow $100,000 to put towards the addition. As a result, the value of the house would increase to $500,000, with the same amount of equity as before, assuming the addition adds $100,000 of value to the house.\n\nWhen your father passes away, the mortgage will need to be repaid. If he has no other assets to be split between the two of you, you and your brother will need to contribute money to pay off the mortgage. To do this, your brother would receive $250, which represents half of the new value of the house. Out of that, he would need to give $50 to the bank to pay off the mortgage. You would also need to give $50 of your own money to the bank for the mortgage. In the end, your brother would be left with $200, which is the same amount he would inherit if the house remained unimproved. Meanwhile, you would be left with a $500,000 home, after spending $300,000 ($100,000 on the renovation and $200,000 to pay off the mortgage).\n\nHowever, if the renovation increases the value of the house by more or less than the amount spent, you and your brother would also share the profit or loss accordingly. If this is not desirable, a different agreement will be necessary. The advantage of the proposed approach is that only one appraisal would be required after your father's passing.\n\nIt should be noted that this plan does not consider the fact that you lived in your father's home without paying rent while serving as his caregiver. Some families may view this as a fair exchange, while others may believe that you should be compensated for your efforts. Alternatively, some may feel that you need to compensate your brother for your privileged living situation. It is essential to discuss these matters with your brother before making any decisions to ensure that everyone agrees on a fair plan."}

{"2519": "\n\nThe term \"ready market\" refers to a market that has genuine buy and sell offers from investors who are willing to trade or own the security or commodity. In contrast, a \"spot market\" implies that the commodity or security is traded for delivery immediately, whereas in a \"futures market,\" the transaction takes place at a predetermined date in the future. Buying a futures contract enables sellers to secure a price that shields them from possible price drops until they deliver the commodity or security. For example, farmers can pre-sell their produce at set prices for future deliveries, thus protecting them from price fluctuations. However, if the price rises, the farmers would lose the difference. Conversely, buyers can profit from the expectation of future price increases. Trading on margins entails borrowing money to invest in a security, whether the trade is long (buying) or short (selling). Typically, margin traders pay a fee or interest rate on the amount they borrow. During a short sale, traders sell securities they do not possess in the hope of buying them back later at a lower price and pocket the difference. The short-seller covers the short by buying back the securities and returning them to their broker.

While it's not necessarily \"bad\" to leave a Roth to charity, it's not as beneficial as giving it to humans if you intend to leave money for them too. In your case, as you intend to leave less money to relatives than the value of your Roth, the advice is to leave $30K of your Roth to your relatives and the entire taxable funds to charity, along with the remaining $20K from the Roth. Essentially, the Roth should only be considered for charitable giving if you have already given all intended money to your beneficiaries. The details of designating beneficiaries can be explored through further research."}

Using your own equipment could be seen as a personal preference rather than an appropriate and helpful business expense. \n\nPlease note that I am not a tax lawyer, and this is not legal advice.

{"2545": "\n\nRevised: Investing in a stock solely based on its dividend is not a wise decision because dividends are never guaranteed. In fact, some companies paying close to 10% dividends may be losing money and may have to borrow funds to maintain their dividends. It's questionable how long these companies can continue to pay dividends at this rate or at all. It's crucial to consider the total return, which includes both dividend yield and capital return, when making investment decisions. Furthermore, high dividend-paying stocks tend to grow slower than lower or non-dividend paying stocks. Therefore, it's important not to base investment decisions solely on a stock's dividend. Also, it's unwise to stay invested in a stock that's falling significantly just because of its dividend. Taxation may also be a factor to consider, but it should never be the determining factor of investment decisions. Ultimately, no one has ever become poor by making a gain and paying some tax, but many have lost a significant portion of their capital by not selling a stock that has lost 50% or more of its value."}

{"2547": "\n\nWhy choose instruments like stocks for funding your children's college education when they are subject to capital gains tax, unlike a home equity loan? Investing in tax-efficient options such as 529 plans, Roth IRAs, Series EE and I bonds can provide numerous benefits for saving towards educational expenses. If distributions are made from a Roth IRA for qualified education expenses, they are tax and penalty free. Although tapping into home equity may seem tempting, it is vital to note that in case of unforeseeable circumstances, defaulting on the loan could result in losing your home. Additionally, the advantages of 529 plans and Roth IRAs do not extend to extravagant purchases such as motor boats. Certain people choose not to use home equity loans for college funding, leaving it untouched for other purposes. \n\nFurther details regarding tax-efficient options for college savings show that 529 plans do not incur federal tax when withdrawals are made for education expenses. At the state level, contributions made to state-sponsored 529 plans are typically deductible. However, 529 plans are not self-directed, so trading stocks and bonds is not possible in these plans. On the other hand, a Roth IRA provides a self-directed investment option with tax-free distributions for qualified education expenses. It's important to remember that there are contribution limits and penalties for non-education-related withdrawals. Finally, investing in Series EE and I bonds can offer tax-free interest revenue, given that the bonds are used for education. While each of these options has distinct terms and limitations, they provide significant tax benefits for higher education funding."}

{"2552": "\n\nIf a company is valued correctly, paying dividends should lower the share price, and buying back shares should leave the share price unchanged. For instance, suppose the share price is $100, and the company pays a $10 dividend. In that case, the company's cash per share goes down by $10, they can borrow money for the same amount, or a combination of both. Regardless, the company's value per share decreases by $10. Similarly, if the company buys back 10 percent of its shares at $100 per share, they will have to find the money to do so. The value of the company also goes down by 10 percent. However, since the number of shares has decreased by the same percentage as the value, the amount of value per share remains the same, resulting in an unchanged share price.\n\nPsychological effects can come into play as well. Many investors prefer receiving dividends, so they will have a tendency to invest in companies with high dividend yields, causing the share price to increase. Similarly, with share buybacks, investors may perceive buying large amounts of shares as a sign of confidence from the company, driving the share price up. However, these effects are purely psychological and do not necessarily reflect the true value of the company.\n\nA share buyback can have a significant impact on a company's value if the shares are undervalued. For example, if a company is truly worth $100 per share, but the market price is only $50, a share buyback can increase the value per share. The company buys from investors who are not aware of the company's true value, thereby increasing the value for investors who hold onto their shares. However, if the share price is already overvalued at $200, buying back shares would be unwise for the company."}

The IRS Publication 505 lists several reasons why you may not be required to pay estimated taxes if your income is below these thresholds. For example, if your total withholding and estimated tax payments for 2014 exceeded your 2013 tax, you should not owe any additional taxes. If you paid one-fourth of last year's taxes (or 110% of them) in estimated taxes for each quarter before the current one, you can simply add any excess due to your next payment and avoid penalties."}

This may require sending a letter or obtaining written confirmation from the company. You may want to seek advice from a consumer protection organization if necessary.\n\nThe second issue is whether the company representative had the authority to make such a significant goodwill gesture. While it is difficult to be sure, it is reasonable to assume that the representative was authorized to offer the points as a gift. However, you should be aware of the legal requirements for accepting a gift in your jurisdiction to ensure that you do not inadvertently engage in fraudulent or deceptive behavior.\n\nLooking ahead, the worst-case scenario would be if the company decides that the gift was not legitimately offered in the first place. This could result in you being required to repay any funds spent beyond what you are entitled to. To avoid this possibility, you should research what constitutes a binding gift in your jurisdiction and demonstrate that the points were given as a gift.\n\nAdditionally, it may be necessary to consider any tax implications related to receiving such a large gift.

However, it is important to note that the APR of 19.9% is not charged all at once. For instance, a $100 balance on your credit card will not incur a 19.9% interest charge, making the new balance $119.90. Instead, you will be charged a periodic rate, which is equivalent to one month's interest. You can easily calculate the periodic rate by dividing the APR by 12. Thus, 19.9% equals 1.65833% per month. This means that for a $100 balance, you will be charged 1.65833% interest, which is rounded up to 1.66, making your new balance $101.66.

{"2571": "\n\nI believe the previous editor, mhoran_psprep, accurately identified the information as pertaining to the US, although it is worth noting that the acronym IRS does not exclusively refer to the US entity as it once included the UK's Inland Revenue (which has since changed). In the US, stockbrokers typically do not withhold on dividends, interest, distributions, or realized capital gains, as gains may be offset by later losses. However, they may be required to apply backup withholding to dividends and interest. Taxpayers are typically required to pay most of their tax obligations throughout the year, either through withholding or through estimated payments, which must equal at least 10% of their tax liability or $1000, whichever amount is greater. If the tax on an individual's income, including recent capital gains, exceeds their withholding by 10% and $1000, they should adjust their withholding, make an estimated payment, or take a combination of both measures. It is important to note that the last week of December is too late to make significant adjustments to withholding or timely estimated payments, particularly if \"earlier in the year\" refers to an earlier quarter as defined for tax purposes (Jan-Mar, Apr-May, June-Aug, Sept-Dec). The IRS website (https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes) provides additional information about estimated taxes, including a link to Publication 505. However, if this is the first time a person has incurred capital gains, they may be eligible for a safe harbor provision. In such cases, if the individual did not owe any income tax the previous year (provided they were a citizen or resident) or, with the exception of high earners, if they owed taxes and their withholding plus estimated payments for the current year is sufficient to cover the previous year's tax liability, they may be exempt from Form 2210 penalties and have until the filing deadline (normally April 15th, but this year extended to April 18th due to a weekend and holiday) to pay. It is worth noting that gains on investments held for longer than one year are classified as long-term and taxed at lower rates, which can reduce the tax liability owed. However, based on the wording \"bought and sold... earlier this year\" it appears the holding period was not long-term, and short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income. Additionally, if a person lives in a state with income tax, similar considerations may apply, although the amounts involved are typically smaller. As far as we know, all states tax capital gains (and other investment income, other than interest on exempt bonds), and the lower rates for long-term gains are not necessarily guaranteed. Additionally, all states we have lived in have rules regarding withholding or estimated payments that are generally similar to those of the federal government, though not identical."}

{"2573": "\n\nRevised: Deciding whether to pay 20% tax now or later can be challenging because it's difficult to predict which tax rate will be higher for you in the future. To make the best choice, one may opt to split their contributions equally between pre-tax and post-tax. For instance, with $20,000, putting $10,000 in each fund may result in a total of $18,000 after taxes, which is midway between the outcomes of either option. This strategy also lowers the tax burden to $2,000 instead of $4,000 if you invested solely in pre-tax. By splitting your investment equally, you guarantee a 50/50 chance of being on the right side, which is better than potentially being 100% wrong. Predicting tax rates decades in advance is complex, so it may be helpful to take a balanced approach to minimize risks."}

Generally, with an ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan), vesting occurs every six months. Accordingly, every half-year, a portion of stocks is granted to an employee based on their salary deduction, with a 15% discount. Subsequently, every six months, there is a sum of money from the sale of these stocks that can be invested in a long-term investment portfolio. This type of investing is known as dollar cost averaging. Specifically, an individual invests on a periodic basis (every six months in this example), allocating the same amount of money (based on their salary deferral) regardless of fluctuating stock market conditions.

This paper outlines the factors that determine the optimal risk level for a given holding period, including expected return and the investor's degree of risk aversion. Using these factors, an investor can construct a risk-averse decision model that selects the best risk level with a focus on median and lower percentile outcomes, while remaining robust to downside risk. These results vary based on the expected risk and return of the portfolio and the degree of risk aversion specified. It's important to note that these results are valid when liquidating the entire portfolio at a specific point in time.

{"2580": "Along with D. Stanley's insightful answer, changes in market conditions and investor perceptions of the impact on a company's future earnings can influence the price of stocks. For example, a shortage of houses in the USA means there are fewer homes available for purchase than buyers, leading investors to predict higher future earnings for home builders compared to ten years ago. As a result, investors may try to buy the stocks, with current owners potentially demanding a premium to make a sale. Conversely, brick-and-mortar retailers are declining as online shopping gains popularity. Investors may expect these companies' future earnings to decrease, leading current owners to sell their stocks before prices drop further, with potential buyers offering low prices to incentivize sales. The broader market also affects stock prices; a strong jobs report with 350,000 new jobs created in July suggests companies are performing well and likely selling more products and services, leading to higher earnings and stock prices for these companies."}

However, executives should remain vigilant of significant swings in their company's share prices as it could indicate important news or information that they are unaware of. It is crucial to consider your shareholders, particularly large institutional players who hold significant voting power to remove unresponsive executives. While swings in market cap mainly affect public perception, companies should have a robust public relations strategy to address any concerns during market events. Sudden drops in share prices may cause consumers to lose trust in the company, therefore impacting future business decisions.

However, unsecured debts may pose more difficulty as they are supported by personal estate defaults. Creditors can sue and win unless their paperwork has issues. Despite that, credit has its value as a wealthy person, and it is worth observing its worthiness. It can leverage your wealth and expand your funds, improving your overall wealth.

{"2588": "\n\nI define investment risk using two measures. Firstly, I examine the longest period over which an investment has had negative returns. This method works well for long-term investments like retirement. To illustrate, I have my retirement portfolio invested in equity, as the Sensex has not had returns for over a decade, making it risk-free over this period. Secondly, I consider the worst-case fall in the investment value (peak to trough). This method is more suitable for short-term investments, such as saving for a car purchase next year. For this, I may choose a debt fund that has had a worst-case loss of 8% over the past decade. Slightly risky, but with a potential for higher returns. In any case, investment amounts for a car are estimated, and an 8% shortfall may not be significant.\n\nThese measures are simple to comprehend and apply in practical situations, unlike complicated concepts such as beta, standard deviation, or information ratio.

In Germany, the Tradegate Exchange and the affiliated bank Tradegate AG have been known to engage in questionable practices.

{"2596": "\n\nThe perceived risk of buying a property with tenants can vary depending on the situation, but it is generally considered to be a higher risk, especially if you plan to occupy the property yourself. There are several factors to consider, such as the difficulty of showing a property with tenants still occupying it. In most cases, homes show and sell better when they are empty. Many tenants can make the selling process challenging by being unaccommodating, leaving the property in disarray, and generally making the process difficult. In markets with lots of options, buyers may not be willing to bother with scheduling showings at occupied properties.\n\nIt can also be challenging to purchase a property with tenants who insist on being present during showings but won't allow access to the property. Landlords in some areas may not be able to enter the property without permission, even if they have a valid reason. Another issue to consider is the length of the current lease. If there are years remaining on the lease, it may not be possible to buy the property and use it for your purposes for some time.\n\nIt is vital to understand the laws in your area regarding tenant eviction, as it can be a complicated process. Additionally, reviewing the security deposit is also vital, as it may not cover all potential damages tenants could cause when moving out.\n\nBefore making an offer, consider the current tenants' history, such as their monthly income, credit history, criminal record, payment history, and references. If you plan to keep the property as a rental, these checks can help you identify whether they would be good or bad renters.\n\nFinally, it's essential to view the property yourself and determine why it hasn't yet sold.

Before that day, the adjusted close price for the stock would be $0.18 lower per share than the straight close. Suppose the closing price remained at $20.00. The straight close price would indicate no profit, but the adjusted close price would read $19.82 in June 2015, and $20.00 in August 2015. This means that by using the adjusted close price, you'd know that you made a $0.18 profit per share on your investment. \n\nIn summary, utilizing the adjusted close price will provide you with a more accurate reflection of your profit per share, and enable you to track your investment performance effectively."}

After seven years, you would pay the remaining 30% of the current value, plus 50% of any increase in the house's value. \n\nHowever, instead of this structure, you pay 70% of today's value upfront and do not pay rent for the portion you do not own. In seven years, you pay 30% of today's value plus 50% of any increase in the value of the house. Essentially, you are exchanging seven years of rent and interest on that portion of the house for 20% of any increase in value. While this may appear disadvantageous, it is still beneficial if the house does appreciate. \n\nOf course, a sound contract is needed with consideration given to unforeseeable events, such as the house burning down or significant increases in value due to renovations.

{"2604": "\n\nOne potential downside to using leverage, or borrowing to invest, is that the return on your investment must be high enough to justify the cost of finance. For example, the average return on the S&P 500 is roughly 9.8%, while the interest rate on a typical unsecured personal loan ranges between 18-36% APR. This often means that you're paying more in interest than you're earning in returns, leading to a negative return on your margin investment. Additionally, during times when the S&P 500 falls, you can end up paying interest on a losing investment, further compounding your losses.\n\nOf course, if you have stellar credit, you may be able to negotiate a lower interest rate; however, this isn't always possible. Secured loans, such as remortgaging your home, offer lower costs, but come with greater risks.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are other ways to use leverage aside from borrowing directly. Margin trading, for example, allows you to post collateral against a loan to buy securities; this is common among day traders and others who hold stocks for short periods. While financing costs for margin trading are often low (intraday margin trading doesn't incur interest), there are high fees if you exceed the loan term. If you hold a losing position overnight, for example, you will be charged a fee that can ultimately result in a loss of profitability.\n\nBecause margin trading is essentially a loan, there is a risk of being bankrupted by losses. Using leverage in any form magnifies your potential profits, but can also magnify your potential losses. In some cases, these losses can exceed your original investment. In addition to considering the costs of finance, you need to ensure that your return over the course of the loan is higher than inflation and other opportunity costs of capital.\n\nIf you decide to invest using leverage, it's crucial to understand the terms and costs involved. Ensure that you monitor your positions carefully and account for any costs associated with your leverage. Additionally, you need to be aware of what happens if your credit runs out or your leverage ratio becomes too high. Remember, the risks associated with leverage can be mitigated by careful management and consideration of all expenses related to your investment strategy."}

Doing so would give the seller an advantage in negotiations."}
{"2615": "\n\nThere are several helpful answers on this website that relate to your question, some with a focus on the US perspective and others without a jurisdictional focus. It is worth reading these answers to gain a well-rounded understanding of early-stage investing. Additionally, there are a few key differences between investing in Canada and the US, including differences in tax regulations, healthcare, and education. \n\nRegarding healthcare and education, it is important to note that the Canadian perspective differs from that of the US, as Canadians have access to government-funded healthcare and education. For investing, there are some general recommendations that apply to both Canada and the US before getting into Canadian-specific investing advice. \n\nOne prominent piece of advice that applies in both countries is to ensure that you have a solid financial foundation before investing. Specific to Canada, some common investment options include Tax Free Savings Accounts (TFSA) and Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSP). With a TFSA, you can contribute a certain amount of money each year to invest in a variety of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Any income earned in this account is tax-free, making it an attractive option for short-term liquid investments. \n\nRRSPs, on the other hand, are geared towards long-term investing, with contributions being tax-deductible in the year they are made. Once you withdraw money from an RRSP, it is considered taxable income. It's worth noting that RRSPs are less liquid than TFSA accounts and have some drawbacks, such as fully taxable income and reduced diversity in investment options. \n\nAnother useful Canadian investment option is the Registered Pension Plan, which operates similarly to an RRSP with the added restriction that withdrawals are typically only allowed in retirement. If you are employed, it is worth checking whether your employer offers matching opportunities for contributions to either an RRSP or RPP. \n\nIt's important to be aware of these investment options and tax regulations in Canada, but it's also essential to research them further yourself to ensure accuracy and thoroughness. Remember that tax laws can change over time, and there might be specific details pertinent to your unique situation that are not covered here."}

Your lawyer should be highly knowledgeable about both the statute and relevant case law in the area where you plan to file. They can advise you on the permissibility of any actions you consider taking and provide counsel as you evaluate whether bankruptcy is the best option for your situation. \n\nYou must understand that filing for bankruptcy entails disclosing a considerable amount of information. You should educate yourself about bankruptcy and ask your lawyer relevant questions about your unique circumstances. It's essential to be aware of potential issues related to your debts and repayments, especially to creditors like relatives. Such actions could prove detrimental to your case, and in some cases, may even be considered criminal, so seeking legal counsel is crucial.\n\nThere are several factors to consider before filing for bankruptcy. Among these factors, it's vital to understand that bankruptcy is governed by federal law, and you'll need to reveal comprehensive details about your financial situation. You'll be required to attend a creditors meeting where you'll need to testify that your provided information is correct. The trustee may raise objections, and your lawyer will need to respond.

Additionally, past results do not guarantee future success in a brokerage account. It is crucial to only invest money in a brokerage account that you are fully prepared to lose.

I understand the fear associated with investing all of one's capital into the stock market, only to see it plummet in value the next day. However, several strategies can help mitigate timing risk. For example, you can avoid investing all your money at once and instead spread your investments over time, such as a few hundred dollars each month. This strategy will average your purchase cost to avoid buying when prices are at their highest. However, this approach may also mean you miss out on potential gains if you leave cash sitting around. Investing in various overseas markets can provide some protection against timing risk, as markets do not always rise and fall in unison. I suggest investing only funds you do not need to withdraw soon to reduce the chance of losing value. Additionally, avoiding monitoring the markets can prevent nervousness and keep you from making poor decisions at the wrong time."}
{"2620": "\n\nYour proposed solution is not viable due to the strict guidelines that banks have regarding FHA loan properties. Remember that FHA only offers insurance to the bank, covering a high percentage of the loan should you default. Banks will not take the risk of violating their insurance policy and having the government refuse to pay them off in the event of a default. Instead, consider alternative options, such as a creative sale of your property, such as a rent-to-own or owner financing deal. As long as you continue to pay the mortgage, the bank will not know that you are not living in the property, and you can rent it out to someone who will eventually buy the property after the agreed-upon timeframe expires. In the meantime, you can search for a new home or condo, either through conventional financing or owner financing, which can be found on the internet. You can use owner financing until the sale of your first property is complete. Alternatively, you can wait for the timeframe to expire and sell your property then. If you bought the property three years ago, you may have some equity, but if you sell, you may have to pay realtor fees and closing costs out of pocket. If you choose to pursue the rent-to-own option, you can sell the property at a slightly higher price, ensuring that you cover these costs. While this solution may be unconventional, it is a viable option that I have used successfully many times in dealing with people who don't want properties.

{"2623": "\n\nMost corporations have a maximum cap on the number of shares that they are allowed to issue, as specified in their corporate charter. Companies generally avoid reaching this limit and sell only a smaller number of shares to retain a buffer for future secondary offerings, employee incentives, etc. A scrip dividend involves distributing authorized shares that were not previously issued, which results in a decrease in the number of shares held for selling in the future for capital. As a result, the assets of the company reduce. In contrast, a split involves dividing every share, including the authorized shares that were not distributed, resulting in a greater number of total shares. The trading price of these shares is typically proportional to the split. However, this split does not reduce the assets of the company."}
{"2624": "\n\nTo make the text more concise and clear, here's a revised version:\n\nBefore deciding between an LLC and a corporation, it's important to understand their similarities and differences. Both have one or more members and can be seen similarly by the IRS, but LLCs can opt for a pass-through tax system, while corporations cannot. In terms of taxes, a flow-through option allows P/L statements to flow through to personal taxes, while a business expense schedule can be filed to claim legitimate business expenses. \n\nWhen it comes to choosing between the two, it depends on whether you have full-time employees or not. S corps limit shares, shareholders, and some deductions, but taxes are only paid by shareholders. C corps have employees, no restrictions on types or number of stock, and no restrictions on the number of shareholders. This means you'll be considered an employee of your business and will have to pay taxes on your income as an individual and as a business. \n\nMost of the differences between LLCs and corporations occur in how profits/losses are distributed between members. If you're considering working with a co-worker, it's best to opt for an LLC, which allows for more flexibility in disbursing funds. A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnerships may allocate members' shares of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member. \n\nFinally, it's worth noting that the tax rate will be based on personal income for any pass-through entity. This means that the same amount earned from an LLC or an S corp, with the same expenses and the same pass-through options, will be taxed the same. Overall, while there are several differences between LLCs and corporations, the best structure for you depends on your unique situation."}

Hence, I have kept all of my tax returns since 1980, which occupies one drawer of a file cabinet and doesn't cause much trouble."}
{"2628": "\n\nIn reality, markets do not always function efficiently and participants are not always rational. As a result, we experience booms and busts within markets. The decisions made by investors and traders are often influenced by emotions and psychology, and can result in unpredictable and irrational behavior. Consequently, stocks may be undervalued or overvalued in comparison to their true value. Additionally, the different methods of analysis used by market participants can lead to varying valuations of a stock. This is why liquid markets always present numerous opportunities for profit or loss. Conducting thorough research and analysis, through fundamental and technical analysis or a combination of the two, is crucial. For instance, fundamental analysis can guide purchasing decisions while technical analysis can determine the best time to buy. Engaging in careful research involves becoming educated, developing a clear plan, conducting rigorous analysis, making investments and trades according to the plan, and having a sound risk management strategy. Unfortunately, many individuals are unwilling to invest the time and effort into research, leading to costly mistakes such as relying on others to conduct research or succumbing to speculation based on hot tips."}
{"2629": "\n\nThe interpretation of the situation can affect the outcome, but the general idea is that if you buy a share at $50 and the price increases to $55, you have an unrealized profit of $5. You can choose to sell and realize the profit, or hold onto the position with the expectation of further price appreciation. Regardless of your decision, you should base it on the latest traded price of $55, rather than the initial purchase price. If the price drops to $52 in the next trade, you would have a loss of $3 on your previous profit of $5. This allows you to make decisions based on the most recent price level, similar to a Markov process. In essence, it doesn't matter how the stock price and your position's P&L arrived at the current point; your focus should be on the present/latest price level."}
{"2630": "\n\nTo simplify, being long is equivalent to betting on the stock's increase in value, while being short is equivalent to betting on its decrease. When you are long on options, you expect their value to rise. When you own an option, you are considered long, and when you have sold it, you are considered short. A short call option means the writer has sold it to the buyer who is now long. Buying a call option is an investment that can increase in value like stocks. The option's value changes with the underlying, and therefore, being long-on an option means being long on its underlying. Buying a long call option requires less initial investment than buying the underlying stock, but it also comes with its own risks. When you buy a share of stock, you acquire ownership rights to the corporation's profits and assets. When you buy an option, you are obtaining a specific right to the stock. Essentially, options are a way to formalize and subdivide property rights within a corporation.

{"2637": "\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the potential outcome of participating in the futures markets, it is crucial to first comprehend the ways in which the slope of these markets can be described. Many futures markets offer the opportunity for someone to purchase a commodity at the spot price and sell a futures contract on it, provided they can store the commodity. However, storing commodities incurs expenses that can drive up the futures price above the spot price. For example, in the case of stock index futures, the holder may receive a potential benefit by having stocks in an index. \n\nThere are varying characteristics of futures markets, with different slopes determined by the relationship between spot and futures prices. Upward sloping futures markets are considered normal, while downward sloping futures markets are referred to as inverted. If the futures market is high enough above the spot price, then it can be called in contango. In contrast, if the futures market is below the point where the commodity can be profitably stored for the future, then the market can be called in backwardation. \n\nIt's important to consider the cost associated with buying futures contracts since buyers are required to hold the contract for a certain period of time. Therefore, the question of how much money can be made or lost depends on whether the price change is related to the spot price or the futures price. In most cases, it's assumed that changes in the futures price will be similar to changes in the spot price. However, for larger price changes, the difference between the expected spot price change in relation to the expected future price change will be more significant. \n\nIf the price eventually goes up, any future gains will be offset by the cost of holding the contract. Conversely, if the price goes down, this holding cost should be factored into the losses. If the contract was purchased above the spot price, then the price will slowly drift toward the spot price, resulting in the holder incurring holding costs. If the price of gold remains the same as the current spot price, then the holder will only be left with this holding cost."}

In such a scenario, refinancing could also be an option.\n\nAdditionally, it may be socially and economically advantageous to prioritize repaying a cosigned loan either through rapid repayment or refinancing. Regarding prepayment, it's best to assess the caveats before making monetary decisions.

{"2645": "\n\nSince paying down a liability and increasing asset equity is not considered an expense, GnuCash will not include it in any expense reports. However, there is a workaround that can be used to achieve the desired outcome. You can begin by dividing the mortgage payment into principle, interest, and escrow/tax/insurance accounts. As an example, the mortgage payment can be recorded as a split transaction that allocates funds into these accounts from your bank account.\n\nTo ensure completeness, the escrow account should be periodically used to pay for actual expenses, which will move the expense from escrow into insurance or tax. This approach prevents expenses from being inflated due to tax payments made in a given month. In most cases, all parts of the mortgage payment will appear in expense reports, except for the principle portion.\n\nTo circumvent this issue, you can create a principle expense account and a fictional equity account that funds it. Each time you record a mortgage payment, transfer funds from the equity account into the Principle Payments expense account.

In fact, banks can go bankrupt or require government bailouts to survive from time to time. Investment banking involves shouldering risks for clients, which inevitably results in losing money occasionally. While most individual transactions do not threaten the entirety of the bank, some risks in investment banking carry the potential of great losses. With regard to your question of how underwriters profit when shares lose value prior to the sale, the explanation is simple: they make a commission. Typically, underwriters receive a predetermined percentage of the proceeds from the sale, irrespective of the actual stock price. Though in some cases, the underwriter's contract may include a minimum price that they are unable to attain. In such a scenario, the underwriter would indeed lose money, undermining your false assumptions. Furthermore, you ask why secondary offerings are viewed negatively. The answer is that if insiders hold private information that an overvaluation exists, then they may profit significantly from a secondary offering at an inflated price. Investors are aware of this possibility, and so, they are cautious when a secondary offering is announced. This can discourage companies from issuing a secondary offering, even if the stocks are reasonably-priced. For this reason, a company that announces a secondary offering is likely to be met with suspicion, even if the shares are discounted."}
{"2655": "\n\nHow would this trade realistically perform? I am uncertain how the simulation manages limit orders and bid/ask spreads to determine feasibility, but buying at $4.04 when the current ask is $8.00 appears improbable. This would indicate that all other sell orders between $8.00 and $4.04 were met, indicating very few sellers or an unexpected spike in sell pressure, both of which seem unlikely. In reality, it is more probable that your order would remain inactive until the ask drops to $4.04 (if it ever does), and then you would have to wait until the bid rises to $7.89 to sell them at that price. Nevertheless, dramatic fluctuations in option prices are not unrealistic. Options trading near at-the-money tend to change at about 50% of the shift in the underlying, meaning if Amazon suddenly dropped by $5, the option price could decrease by $2.60 (from $6.66 to $4.04) and subsequently rise back to $7.89 if the price increased by $8 (which would represent a 1% swing and is not unheard of intra-day). However, it seems as though you experienced extremely good luck (or the simulation does not realistically depict option trading). I have traded options in the past and, like you, have experienced some lucky breaks. However, I have also had terrible breaks where I lost all of my investment (the options expired out-of-the-money).

{"2658": "I am confused about how a 4K loan could negatively affect your credit score if payments are made on time. FICO scores are based on how well you borrow and pay back on time. This should not negatively impact your score in the long run and may even improve it. If you are concerned about your score, you could consider using a credit card, but keep in mind that this may increase your interest payments in the short term. Using a significant portion of your available credit may also have a slight negative impact on your score in the short term, but this should improve as you make payments. If you are not planning on buying a home in the near future, a small short-term dip in your score should not greatly affect your life.

{"2665": "As you likely know from reading Hull's classic, the valuation of bonds is fundamentally tied to the risk of the entity defaulting on those bonds. Let's focus on the United States and their debt issuance strategy. The US has an upper hand over corporations in issuing bonds, since it has the ability to print the currency that the debt is denominated in. This makes defaulting on debt less likely, as the US can always print more money to pay it off. However, printing excessive currency can lead to inflation and diminish the value of debt - this includes US corporate bonds. Therefore, highly-rated corporate bonds have a similar interest rate to government debt, with a slight increase due to the extra default risk of the corporation.\n\nThe situation with AA-rated governments is more complex. Most governments have debt denominated in their local currency, which would suggest them to have similar interest rates. However, some governments have higher or lower rates compared to the US. This is due in part to the risk of printing too much currency during times of crisis, as well as the international flow of money. However, the primary difference in interest rates between AA governments is influenced by money flow, central banks, and regulation. Bonds are primarily traded based on supply and demand, which is heavily influenced by governments. Central banks, for example, may purchase substantial amounts of debt, which increases demand and lowers rates. Regulators may also require banks to hold specific amounts of treasuries, thereby inflating demand.\n\nRegarding your question, the US has certain advantages arising from its long history of stability, controlled inflation, and a substantial economy, making treasuries highly valuable as low-risk investments. As a result, their interest rates are often on the low end. However, government manipulation can also impact interest rates, meaning the US is not always the lowest."}

{"2669": "\n\nIf payment is not made by the due date on the invoice, the transaction becomes null and void, and the artwork can be sold to another client. To prevent such situations in the future, it would be wise to implement a sales contract and agreement of original transfer of artwork for all future sales. The contract should incorporate either full payment at the time of signing or a deposit at signing with full payment due within a certain number of days after delivery. Additionally, the contract must stipulate a late fee for non-payment and specify how long the artwork will be held before the client forfeits their deposit and rights to the work.\n\nFurthermore, it is wise to have a grace period in case the client changes their mind about the purchase. You can make it zero grace period, making all sales final and upon signing of the agreement, the client agrees to the terms and is locked into the sale. If they refuse to honor the agreement, they forfeit all deposits paid.\n\nA similar agreement can be implemented in a custom web design business requiring a deposit of 50% in advance before work can commence, an additional 25% at the time the client accepts the design/layout, and the final 25% at delivery of the finished product. If the client fails to meet the requirements of the contract for the second or third installment payments, all money paid is forfeited, and the client owes 70% of the total quoted project price for wasting the company's time.

When using stop losses, especially when going long, consider the support lines. If the stock is on an upward trend but experiencing a decline due to profit-taking, positioning yourself closest to the next support line is your best bet. By placing your stop just below the support, you increase your chances of a winning position since most technical analysts view support as a buy-back area. The opposite applies during a bear market. Once you've taken your position and the market moves beyond the first resistance line, it's advisable to adjust your stop just below that line since resistance becomes support once broken.

Some of the ins and outs will depend on the province you are considering and the area within that province. For example, if you plan to own property in Montreal, you (or someone) will need to operate in the French language. The Canada dollar is currently weak, so it could be an excellent time to buy property in Canada. The non-resident tax rate is applied at 25% on the gross rental income paid or credited to you, but you may choose to elect under section 216 of the Income Tax Act, which allows you to pay tax on your net Canadian-source rental income, providing that the non-resident tax withheld by the payer is more than the amount of tax payable calculated on your section 216 return. You can find additional information regarding tax guidelines at Canada Revenue's site. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation site is a good resource for statistics and other relevant information.\n\nThe market information for condos and townhomes may be found on the stat site mentioned above, and the down payment requirements for non-owner-occupied properties are at least 20%. Regarding the issue of double taxation, you may claim the foreign tax credit to avoid this; additional information about this and property taxes is available in IRS Topic 514 - Foreign Tax Credit and Publication 856 - Foreign Tax Credit for Individuals. \n\nThere may be exceptions and stipulations based on your particular circumstance, so it is essential to do your research and gather additional information on your own.

Similarly, your friend should connect their expenses with their desired savings goal. Although your friend may prefer takeout to saving a small percentage of their travel expenses, they must make a conscious decision to choose wisely. However, if cooking is a challenge for your friend, this requires a different discussion. As a guide, you may need to instruct your friend on essential skills, such as cooking.

However, when determining the best option for your situation, simply calculating the rate or total interest for the entire term, such as 10, 15, or 30 years, may not be sufficient. To illustrate, consider a car's gas mileage. Reporting how many gallons of gas a car will consume over its lifetime is not very useful when trying to decide between vehicles. A car that uses 5000 gallons of gas may not necessarily be a better choice than one that uses 6000 gallons but has a longer lifespan."}
{"2674": "\n\nThe Smith Maneuver involves leveraged investing, meaning you're gambling on the stock market using borrowed money. Although not as dangerous as getting money from a loan shark in Vegas to play blackjack, there's always the risk that the market could collapse, causing your investment's value to rapidly drop. Your level of risk depends on the specific investments you choose and how diversified they are. For example, if you only buy Canadian stocks, you're at risk of losing a lot if something happened to the country's economy. However, if Canadian equities only account for 3.6% of your total investments and you hold stocks in many different countries, the diversification will reduce the overall risk. \n\nIt's worth noting that many people using the Smith Maneuver prefer to purchase Canadian high-yield dividend stocks for the purpose of accelerating the process. They use the dividends to pay down their mortgage before borrowing more to invest it. However, if something were to happen to those Canadian companies, investors could lose a significant portion of their investment value and suddenly find themselves with additional debt from HELOC or re-advanceable mortgage, without enough value in the investments to offset it. This could result in an inability to pay off the mortgage by retirement."}
{"2675": "The Globe and Mail recently published an article detailing alternatives for utilizing your RRSPs. However, it should be noted that this article was written in early 2011 and rules may have changed since then. One suggestion they offered was the option of holding your own mortgage within your RRSP. Essentially, if you have $100,000 already in your RRSP and your remaining mortgage is $100,000, you can use that money to pay off your mortgage, pay back the money at interest and generate a tax-deferred profit in your RRSP. This method may be a viable option, but it is recommended that you discuss this with your accountant first. On the other hand, lending money from your RRSP to someone else for a second mortgage carries a high level of risk and should be dealt with cautiously. Once an RRSP contribution is made, that contribution room is used up with the exception of the life-long learning plan. Hence, if you use $100,000 of your RRSP to loan to someone for a second mortgage, any interest payments are sheltered within the RRSP (as a substantial benefit). Nevertheless, if that person defaults on the second mortgage, which is a significant possibility, you stand to lose your entire $100,000 contribution room and the $100,000 that was loaned out. It is not easy to determine if it is wise to invest in risky second-mortgage loans, and it cannot be said for sure whether this investment should be executed within an RRSP. It is important to recognize that there are substantial risks involved in the loan, as well as both costs and benefits to the RRSP option. Hopefully, this information has assisted in guiding your decision-making process."}

{"2678": "\n\nNSCC illiquid charges refer to fees applied to low-priced over-the-counter (OTC) securities with low trading volumes. Your firm's open net buy quantity, which is the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a 3-day settlement cycle, must be less than 5,000,000 shares per stock. This means that you are not allowed to hold a long position of more than 5 million shares in an illiquid OTC stock without incurring a fee, even if you accumulate this size position through multiple transactions. Additionally, your open net sell quantity, which is the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a 3-day settlement cycle, must be less than 10% of the 20-day average volume. If you sell a number of shares greater than 10% of the stock's average volume over the last 20 days, you will also face a fee.\n\nIt is important to note that even if your account does not meet the criteria, you may still be charged a fee for trading OTC stocks. This is because these restrictions are applied at the level of the clearing firm, not the individual client. Therefore, if other investors in your broker or even in another broker that uses the same clearing firm purchase more than 5 million shares in an individual OTC stock at the same time, all of your accounts may face fees. Although these fees are assessed to the clearing firm, the clearing firm usually passes them along to the broker and charges a fee to the individual account(s) that triggered the restriction.\n\nWhen buying OTC/pink sheet stocks, your ability to buy or sell is dependent on finding someone else to buy from/sell to.

{"2684": "\n\nThe company recently released its 2nd Quarter Revenue of $1,957,921, however, the stock did not show any upward movement. This raises the question, if the company is generating profits, why is the stock not increasing? Between earnings announcements, analysts frequently publish their evaluations of a company, which often includes their assessment of the company's value and future earnings. Companies also provide guidance as part of their earnings reports, which is their projection for the upcoming quarter. However, these estimates are typically conservative to ensure they are achievable. Investors base their buying and selling decisions on this information. When the earnings report is released, investors compare the actual returns to the analysts' predictions and the company's guidance. If the results are in line with these forecasts, the stock price is unlikely to change much, as those outcomes are already reflected in the stock price. If the company performs better than expected, the stock price generally rises, and vice versa. However, the situation is not that straightforward because, in the case of long-term investors, stock prices are primarily based on expectations of future activity.

{"2689": "\n\nI'm no expert, but I don't believe it will be possible to roll your current mortgage into a new one. The bank will require that the new loan is fully collateralized by the new house, which means you'll need to make sure the construction cost is low enough to cover the current loan and keep the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio low. \n\nFor example, if you currently owe $40k on your mortgage and plan to build a $200k house, you'll need to keep your LTV below 80%, so you can spend no more than $160k on the construction. If you want to roll your existing loan into the new loan, you'll need to spend less than $120k on the construction.\n\nHowever, building a $200k house for $120k is unlikely, unless you live in an area with high land value and hire the builders directly. Otherwise, you'll need to make up the difference in cash, which can be challenging if you also lose the value of the current house.\n\nA better alternative may be to sell the current house as-is, perhaps to someone who could rebuild with cash, or consider a home equity loan to renovate parts of the house that would increase its market value, such as remodeling bathrooms or adding a room. Ultimately, the feasibility of these options depends on the current value of the house, the cost of the rebuild, and the value of the new house."}
{"2690": "\n\nThe text has been revised below:\n\nEssentially, what you're suggesting is akin to investing with leverage which usually involves a margin account. This account allows an investor to borrow funds at a lower interest rate, invest the money, and hopefully, generate returns that are higher than the interest rate. Is this approach safe? That is entirely dependent on the performance of your investments and the interest rate of your loan. The higher the interest rate of your loan, the riskier your investments must be to generate returns that outpace the interest rate. If the returns exceed the interest rates, then congratulations! You've made a profit. You should continue investing and pay the minimum payment on your loan to maximize the amount of capital you can invest. If not, then it's best to use your excess funds to pay down your loan.\n\nRegarding investments, aside from stocks and other traditional options, are there other alternatives that could work in my favor? Given the current low interest rates (at least in the US), it's unlikely that you'll find savings accounts or CDs that offer interest rates that are higher than your loan's. If you're uncomfortable with the risk associated with stocks and bonds (which is understandable!), know that there's a wide range of risk levels to choose from. It's up to you to determine how much risk you're willing to bear to achieve your desired returns."}

Rebalancing involves restoring the original allocation without conducting any research or receiving recommendations. For instance, if you assigned 10% of the funds to each of the ten stocks, rebalancing would involve buying or selling stocks to revert to the original allocation. If new funds are being put into the portfolio, the allocation can be adjusted to balance without selling. Similarly, when withdrawing funds, the selling can be adjusted. However, if the objective is to make decisions on altering stocks held in the portfolio, this is an entirely distinct question from rebalancing."}
{"2692": "\n\nRevised: When inflation is high or increasing, interest rates are typically raised to discourage excessive spending and mitigate inflationary pressure. As interest rates climb, people are less inclined to borrow and more inclined to deposit their money in the bank to earn a generous interest rate. In turn, people tend to spend and invest less in alternative assets. Conversely, when inflation is low and the economy slows, interest rates may be increased to stimulate increased spending and reignite the economy. As interest rates decrease, savers may withdraw their money from banks to pursue more lucrative investment opportunities, and borrowing becomes more attractive. As a result, consumers tend to spend more and invest their funds outside of traditional bank savings accounts."}

{"2694": "\n\nWhile derivative pricing models continue to evolve with increasing investment from academia, none are yet perfect. For instance, assuming lognormal stock returns for options pricing, as Black Scholes does, results in a dependency on log-standard deviation, or \"volatility,\" which produces the infamous \"volatility smile.\" However, models that account for other mathematical moments such as mean, skew, and kurtosis eliminate this phenomenon. Despite this, more advanced models still suffer extreme time mispricing, like Black Scholes. \n\nIn any model, the degree of complexity affects computational efficiency and the chance of finding a closed form. While dividend pricing models can account for taxation complexities, their computational complexity increases as well. Generally, for equities with low interest rates, low dividend yields, low volatility, and low dividend taxes, standard swap pricing models are not substantially different with single low dividend tax rates assumed. However, if pricing swaps for equities with different characteristics, dividend tax rates could play a more significant role. \n\nUltimately, closed-form models depend on assumptions. If pricing anomalies arise between market prices and a swap model, it indicates that the model with smaller but similar anomalies is more precise. It is difficult to reach a conclusion based on the current academic data. It is unlikely that swap sellers would forgo the tax advantages of equity swaps, which both parties are aware of, without raising prices. Regardless of the model, volatility curves persist."}

Using this method, you calculate a prorated tax for the partial year by using your income, deductions, and other tax-relevant information for each of the four \"quarters\" (3, 2, 3, and 4 months long) and pay any excess over the amount already paid. However, if your income and deductions vary over the year, this computation will not result in payments that are 3, 2, 3, and 4/12ths of 90% of your whole-year tax. If you use this method, remember to file form 2210 schedule AI with your next return to demonstrate that your quarterly computations and payments met the requirements. Keep good per-period or per-month records of all tax-relevant amounts, and consider using software or professional preparers to complete the form correctly.\n\nPartnerships can complicate matters. As a partner, your taxable income and expenses are not necessarily the cash you receive or pay, but rather your allocated share of the partnership's income and expenses. If the partnership distributes these amounts, they are usually distributed at the year-end draw. If this distribution is significant (more than 5% of your total income) and the partnership is not tracking and reporting these amounts promptly, it might be challenging to compute your quarterly taxes correctly and avoid penalties. If the amount is reasonably predictable, you can use a conservative guess to compute your payments and divide the actual full-year amounts on your K-1 over 12 months for 2210-AI. Note that the \"quarters\" are closer to 13, 9, 13, and 17 weeks, but it is the months that matter."}

For instance, Berkshire Hathaway is a publicly-traded holding company that files several reports with the SEC, including an Annual Report, which you can monitor on the SEC's website. Private and non-profit foundations such as Harvard and Yale have to submit Form 990 filings to the IRS, which you can access through resources like GuideStar.org or the FoundationCenter.org. It is vital to note that if a private foundation holds a substantial amount of shares in a particular company, they are also required to report their buying or selling intentions.

{"2701": "\n\nWhat is the present value of using the payment plan? The present value of a loan is the amount you can pay in the present to avoid taking a loan - in this case, the lump sum payment of $2495. Although the question appears to be a trick, we can also calculate the present value required to pay the loan while earning an 8% return on the stock market. Assuming the lender's APR is 9.6% per month, we can calculate for both an 8% annual effective and 8% annual nominal rate.\n\nIf you have $x in hand, it is exactly enough to take the loan while investing in the stock market. In successive months, the value is $x plus the market return less the loan payment. By the third month, the loan is paid off, and the balance is zero. Therefore, the present value of using the payment plan while investing is $2569.37, which is more than the lump sum payment of $2495. It is advisable to make the lump sum payment because it is less expensive.\n\nTo determine what rate of return the stock market needs to yield to make the loan worth taking, we can calculate the APR proposed by the loan. The present value of a loan is equal to the sum of the payments discounted to present value. By comparing the $2495 lump sum payment with $997 over 3 x monthly instalments, we can find the interest rate implied by the loan. Solving for r, if you could obtain 9.64431% per month on the stock market, the $x cash in hand required would be equal to the lump sum payment, indicating that the calculated interest is comparable to the stock market rate of return. If you could gain more than 9.64431% per month on the stock market, it would be better to invest and take the loan.\n\nThe recurrence form shows that the calculation is equivalent to the loan formula. The present value can be calculated using the formula, assuming an 8% monthly stock market return or an 8% annual effective rate compounded monthly."}

The term was coined by Farida Khambata of the International Finance Corporation in 1992 and is commonly used to describe the equity markets of smaller and less accessible countries in the developing world that are still deemed \"investable\".

Another factor that works in your favor is if a company that knows you agrees to extend more credit, as this indicates that they believe you are a trustworthy borrower. On the other hand, you must exercise caution when it comes to the overall credit limit you have been approved for as it is not advisable to use all the credit and then be unable to pay your bills. It is important to maintain control over your credit and not appear out of control or reckless. Utilizing the services of a payday lender, for instance, is strongly discouraged as it reflects poorly on your financial situation.

{"2714": "\n\nFirstly, it is important to consider the factors that cause taxes to apply to mutual funds, whether they are index or actively managed. Dividends and capital gains are typically the distributions made to shareholders in mutual funds, since the fund itself doesn't pay taxes. However, this may not be a concern for funds held in tax-advantaged accounts, such as IRAs, as investors may not have to worry about this for such situations. This is especially common for investors who have 401(k)s and IRAs that hold their investments rather than taxable accounts.\n\nSecondly, it is worth noting that there are tax-managed funds available. While the linked \"Dummies\" article makes a generalization, there are cases where a fund is managed with taxes in mind. For taxable accounts, it may make more sense to opt for a tax-managed fund rather than an index fund. However, it is important to be careful with asset allocation, as trying to maintain a pure investment style can require selling stocks that have grown too big, which could trigger capital gains. For example, small-cap and mid-cap funds may not be able to hold onto winners as they would become mid-cap and large-cap instead of representing the intended asset class.\n\nIf you want a specific example of the potential risks of active management, consider the 1998 Businessweek story \"A Fund That Played it Safe--and Was Sorry.\" This story highlights an actively managed fund that went mostly to cash but missed out on the rise of the stock market at that time. In contrast, index funds are designed to track the index and stay invested all the time."}

In particular, diversifying into different asset classes can help reduce risk. While I will mainly discuss stock market investing, the principles I mention also apply to other types of investments. With respect to stock market investing, there are two general management styles to consider: passive and active. Passive investing is based on buying ETFs across asset classes and holding on to them without much intervention. However, its profitability depends heavily on entry and exit prices, making it less reliable. Active investing, on the other hand, involves using set criteria to make informed decisions about when to buy and sell stocks. While my example is based on a simplistic technical trading system and arbitrary time frames, I suggest that active investing with similar principles would likely out-perform passive investing over a 10 year time frame."}

{"2729": "\n\nIn my opinion, the approach you are taking is incorrect. While it is true that the material you are reading is often marketing material, the term \"Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)\" is not a universally used financial jargon. On the other hand, \"Dollar Cost Averaging\" is a commonly used term in finance and is taught in US finance classes. Various studies have shown that individuals generate better investment returns when they avoid trying to time the market or pick specific winners. When investing in a mutual fund, dollar cost averaging means investing the same dollar amount at regular intervals instead of buying a fixed number of shares or buying sporadically based on the market conditions. For instance, investing $50 every Wednesday yields better returns than buying one share for $50 each week or investing the entire $850 on the first Wednesday. To further illustrate, let's consider the Vanguard Large Cap Fund (VLCAX). Although our investment amounts may differ, I aimed to demonstrate how the method of investing affects the rate of return subtly. By investing a standard dollar amount as opposed to a standard share amount, the average share price is lower while the share price climbs, and it also makes budgeting more manageable. Vanguard's research, which is illustrated in the third column above, shows it is wiser to invest as soon as funds are available, rather than dividing the lump sum into several smaller periodic investments. Considering that all of these companies are trying to attract customers, they all have marketing teams who create unique and interesting names for their services.

It's important to note that even if there's no net income, a tax return still needs to be filed, as filing and paying taxes are two different things. Additionally, states may have additional fees or taxes, such as sales tax or franchise taxes depending on what is sold and how it's sold. It's essential to determine these obligations according to state law. Seeking professional tax and accounting advice to understand specific situations and requirements is highly recommended.

{"2751": "\n\nThe price-earnings ratio is simply the price of a stock divided by its earnings. However, earnings are not fixed and for a growing company, future earnings may be higher. You should therefore consider future earnings when estimating the company's value today. Unfortunately, future earnings are worth less than present earnings due to inflation and opportunity cost. For instance, a $100 bill you will receive in 20 years will be worth less than $100 today. This is why discounted cash-flow analysis is necessary: it allows you to determine the value of future cash flows by discounting them to their present value. The formula for determining the value of future cash flow involves adding up all future earnings and discounting them by a compounded rate. However, using the formula requires a bit more than simple division, as you must discount each year's earnings individually. A discount rate of 11% per year and five years of earnings growth of 10% have been assumed in this case. For the sake of keeping things simple, please refer to Wikipedia for the full formula."}

Cash value insurance may be a prudent choice if you are not maxing out your retirement accounts; otherwise, term insurance should suffice, and you should aim to save as much as possible for retirement. However, if you can contribute more than $5-10,000 annually to a life insurance policy for at least seven years after maxing out your retirement savings, purchasing a low face value whole life policy from a top mutual insurance company with a paid-up addition rider may prove beneficial. Over this period, your policy's cash value may increase by roughly 2% to 4% annually \u2013 a rate comparable to that of municipal bonds \u2013 offering some protection against inflation. In this time, both the policy's cash value and death benefit should increase significantly, allowing you to draw on your policy's cash value in the future as needed, through policy loans.

However, it is important to note that obtaining a mortgage with a smaller deposit often results in higher interest rates. The decision process for a mortgage depends on several factors such as credit history, income, spending habits, and the loan amount requested. In terms of advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional banks, building societies do offer the peace of mind of FSCS deposit guarantees, as well as potentially higher interest rates on savings accounts. Additionally, as a member with an account, one also becomes a partial owner of the building society, which is not the case with traditional banks.

Essentially, it is a type of income that does not require consistent work, unlike regular employment where you are paid per day or hourly. Passive income is earned through one-time work that generates ongoing payments, such as royalties for recording artists or book authors. Some online business models can also generate passive income through automated systems that drive traffic and sales. While this can be achieved through search engine optimization, pay-per-click advertising or media buying, it requires specialized skills and can be expensive and time-consuming to set up.\n\nA preferred method of generating passive income for many people is hands-free property investing. Property investing has the advantage of full ownership and control over capital invested, allowing an investor to make decisions on selling and maximizing returns. This is unlike business investing, which has other variables, such as market factors or employee performance, that can affect returns.

{"2763": "\n\n\nWhen making an offer, the buyer may choose to disclose their financing arrangements to the seller as it can make their offer more attractive. However, closing a deal typically takes between 30 to 60 days and if the buyer is unable to come up with the necessary funds by then, the offer falls through, which can be risky for the seller. Therefore, it is beneficial for the seller to understand the likelihood that the buyer can obtain the necessary cash by the closing date before accepting an offer. The amount of the down payment compared to the amount of financing is also relevant to the seller. \n\nFor example, when I sold a house, the buyer did not have any money for a down payment and was even borrowing the closing costs. Although we accepted their offer, the bank's appraisal came in lower than the purchase price. This would not have been an issue usually, as long as the appraisal was higher than the amount borrowed. However, because the amount borrowed was higher than the appraisal, the deal was at risk. To continue, the buyer would have had to find additional funds (which they were unable to do), or we would have had to lower the price. It was a risk accepting the offer from a buyer with no funds, but in our case, we were fortunate and found errors in the appraisal, which were corrected."}

There are several firms that specialize in this, and a web search for \"intra-family loan\" will provide numerous options. However, the paperwork and filing fees cost around $700, so it may not be worth considering unless you'll pay at least three times that in interest over the loan's life. For an additional fee, the firm can handle payment processing to make the process more hands-off. It's unclear whether the processing fees and paperwork costs are deductible as a cost of producing the income. Note that the IRS sets a minimum interest rate on intra-family loans, typically around 0.3%. This sets a floor on what the lender must declare and pay taxes on.

Additionally, it is possible to execute a partial fill while simultaneously avoiding a modified order in the system. This can be done by marking the order Immediate-or-Cancel (IoC).

{"2780": "I apologize if my reference to Fox News offended you. My intention was not to suggest that you lack knowledge, but I would like to clarify that 403(b) is not a pension account. Pension accounts are typically \"defined benefit\" accounts, while 403(b)/401(k) accounts and similar are \"defined contribution\" accounts. The difference between the two is significant - pension accounts create a liability for the employer, while defined contribution accounts do not. With pension accounts, the employer commits to paying a certain amount at retirement, regardless of the employee/employer contributions or the account's performance. This makes it a debt-like obligation. Defined contribution accounts, on the other hand, do not create this liability - the employer is only committed to the current match. The employee manages the account after that, and whatever is in the account at retirement is theirs.\n\nThe problem with pension accounts is that many employers have promised defined benefits but did not allocate enough money to pay for them. As a result, these pension accounts have become debts rather than assets, and the retirees are debt holders. If the employer cannot pay its debts, the retirees may not receive their full benefits. This has happened in many places, including Detroit.\n\n403(b) accounts are a solution to this problem because they are defined contribution accounts. Rather than promising defined benefits, employers commit to defined contributions. After that, it is up to the employee to manage their account and ensure they have enough savings at retirement."}

The IRS has specifically outlined where loan interest can be deductible, such as in Publication 936 for home mortgage interest deductions and Publication 970 for student loan interest deductions.

{"2784": "\n\nAfter conducting research, I discovered that several sources suggest the Indo-US treaty provision only extends for five years. For example, on page 20, one reference states that the treaty exemption for students generally lasts for the first five calendar years, except for students from Belgium, Bulgaria, China, The Netherlands, and Pakistan. However, I was unable to locate a specific timeframe in either the treaty itself or the technical explanation. The explanation states that an Indian resident who visits the United States as a student, becomes a U.S. resident, and is not a U.S. citizen or immigrant is exempt from U.S. tax according to this Article. However, the treaty explicitly outlines that the benefits of this provision only last for the period reasonably required to complete the education or training undertaken. The purpose of this paragraph is to avoid artificially prolonging student status, and the five-year limit may stem from the interpretation of this clause. A similar provision exists in the US-China treaty, where exemptions are restricted to the time necessary to complete the education or training. The period for the most undergraduate college or university degrees is typically four years, and for advanced degrees like medicine, the required time may be longer, up to seven years. As such, it is my personal belief that if you are an undergraduate student working toward the same degree, you may no longer qualify for the treaty benefit. I recommend seeking advice from a professional tax expert, such as an EA/CPA licensed in your state, for more reliable guidance on this matter. Please note that I am not a tax professional, and my comments do not constitute tax advice."}
{"2785": "\n\nLong-term government bonds are highly sensitive to seemingly small fluctuations in interest rates because they discount many years of future cash inflows at low rates. However, this sensitivity is less pronounced in a high interest rate environment. For instance, with a 4% interest rate, the principal repayment on a bond after 30 years is only about 1/3 of what it is today. In contrast, an overnight loan with an unrealistic 4% interest rate is worth almost the same as the principal, but is only worth a fraction of the principal after 30 years. This phenomenon is more profound in low-interest rate economies, where overnight interest rates are often double that of US long-term rates, while long-term rates are almost 10 times larger than US long-term rates.\n\nIf there were more supply of longer maturities with reasonable interest rates, a 4% increase in a 30-year bond's interest rate would only lead to a 20% decrease in bond price, whereas a 4% increase for a 4% bond would cause a 50% decrease in bond price. The easiest long-term bond to manipulate quantitatively is the perpetuity, where p is the price of the bond, i is the interest payment per year, and r is the interest rate paid per year. Since these values are interdependent, one can derive a price for a given interest rate and vice versa, provided that the interest payment is known or assumed. For example, at a 4% interest rate, the price is X, while at a 4.04% rate, the price is X-0.8%.\n\nWith longer-term bonds, such as 30 or 20-year bonds, price movements are not as extreme due to the longer maturity period. For instance, the constant maturity 30-year treasury has fluctuated between 5% and 2.5% to approximately 3.75% now. This means that prices have more or less doubled and then reduced because bond prices are inversely proportional to interest rates. Conversely, with shorter maturities, such as the one-month bill, this phenomenon is negligible because future cash inflows are discounted at such a low rate. While the one-month bill rarely fluctuates beyond its bid/ask spread during an economic expansion, it can be expected to experience price drops before and rebounds after a recession."}

While discounts for buying company stock can be alluring, investing in a single stock is inherently risky, as market conditions may lead to sharp drops in its value. Additionally, is it wise to invest both your salary and savings in one basket? These are the two main reasons why I have abstained from participating in Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) throughout my career, despite having been tempted 20 years ago. While owning some stock worked out reasonably well for me, it could have just as easily went the other way. It's important to consider your timeline for holding the stock and whether you can handle drastic drops in its value. Some of my colleagues continue to invest in their company's ESPP but choose to sell right after every purchase to avoid short-term losses.

For instance, a rise in bond, note or bill prices indicates an increase in the current price and decrease in the yield to maturity. As of early 2012, the short-term rate is close to zero, and the Fed has already utilized its tools, including setting short-term rates, to their maximum extent. However, mortgages are typically based on 10-year rates, which requires the Fed to lower long-term rates further. The next step in the Fed's strategy is to purchase 10-year notes in substantial quantities, thus impacting the yield at that point on the curve. By buying (recall supply/demand), the price is increased, and for debt, a higher price translates into a lower yield. To finance this, short-term debt will be sold.

The aforementioned options mostly apply to farmland or other special-purpose land. Real estate professionals generally run \"comps\" to provide rough estimates of FMV based on recent sales in the same area for similar houses. \n\nIt is important to note that tax assessment may or may not be accurate depending on tax laws and consistency with the actual market. Getting an independent appraiser to appraise the value of the property and include that assessment with the will is not necessary - another appraisal will likely be done as part of the estate process after death.

For instance, if you need $20,000 and find a fund that has delivered 8% returns over the past two decades, you will need to save $110 each month for ten years, or $273 monthly for five years. This would be a time-value of money calculation.\n\nAlthough purchasing a house is a long-term goal, similar calculations can be done.

{"2804": "\n\nCan the weights of ETF's change? Yes, they can. However, whether or not they will change depends on various factors. ETF's are not fixed from their inception to their de-listing. It is not possible for the weights to remain fixed since different assets offer different returns. Thus, the weights of ETF's are constantly changing as long as the market is moving. Fund managers usually rebalance their portfolios after a certain period or substantial market move, bringing the weights back to a certain target. The target weights may not necessarily be the same as the initial weights, but they depend on the ETF's objective, as stated in the prospectus. For instance, if the manager drops the weight of the most volatile stock, the ETF's returns and the returns of the 5 stocks it tracks could be substantially different in the next period. This is undesirable when an ETF's objective is to track the performance of its underlying assets. Most ETFs are passively-managed, and the fund managers do not earn fees for active management. Therefore, they have no incentives to adjust the weights if their portfolios are tracking the benchmarks satisfactorily."}

{"2809": "\n\nAlthough JB King offers some useful insights, I believe there is another fundamental reason why stock markets tend to decrease after natural or man-made disasters. Such events have a significant impact on the economy, for instance, the aftermath of 9/11, which led to closed airports, increased security costs, tighter visa restrictions, further trade inspections, actual payments for rebuilding shattered buildings, insurance payouts for lost lives, and, eventually, the cost of war. However, the primary driver behind market downturns is the uncertainty and risks involved. Nobody knows what might happen after a catastrophic incident, and the fear of the unknown can have a severe impact on the economy. Questions such as will there be another attack a week later, or every week for the next year? Will traveling by air become impractical? Will global trade become massively restricted? All these potential outcomes can have a tremendous, terrifying effect on the stock market. \n\nIt is true that some may argue that these events are unlikely or that the markets will recover relatively soon after, yet even a minimal increase in the possibility of a devastating economic crash is more than enough to initiate panic selling. The reality is that an overreaction to uncertainty and perceived risk can drive the market down, regardless of the actual probability of the crash. If traders think the market is going down, even if they believe there is little risk of a crash, they may start to sell, exacerbating the situation further. This creates a domino effect, drawing in more investors and causing significant price drops. Eventually, the market will bottom out, and those who initially believed there was no crash risk may start to buy in the hopes of benefiting from the eventual recovery. Regrettably, this recovery usually only happens once there has been a substantial drop in the market's value."}

When it comes to medium-term money allocation, focusing on cash accumulation is a reasonable idea, as it minimizes your risk of withdrawing funds during a stock market crash. However, considering that you possess the means to take on a higher level of risk, it would be advisable to allocate a large portion of your funds to a general bond fund with some percentage towards equities, reducing the equity portion each year as you draw nearer to your goal, and transitioning some percentage of funds to liquid cash. This plan should provide a reasonable expected return while reducing the chance of having to make a sale during a crisis near your purchase date.

For example, in most EU countries, the state guarantees deposits up to 100kEUR. Companies like forex or currency exchanges aim to avoid as many regulations as possible due to the high cost. When a company offers guarantee funds and customer insurance, it should disclose it on their website. However, trusting a financial service provider is misleading since you do not have to \"trust\" your grocery store to purchase there, nor is there a guaranteed taste guarantee for the groceries. Like any other product, financial services should be treated similarly. I suggest that your aunt starts with smaller transactions and increases the amount if the service is reliable while decreasing transactions done via the bank.

{"2815": "\n\nRevised: Companies strive to maintain high stock prices for various reasons, but a solid growth plan typically leads to stable prices without intervention. However, some companies resort to measures such as using cash or issuing bonds to sustain dividends, or buying back stocks, which may temporarily inflate prices but are not sustainable and may be viewed as desperate. Bonds, on the other hand, follow a straightforward valuation model based on fixed monthly payouts, and their prices are impacted by interest rates and credit ratings. The price of bonds matters to governments because it affects their ability to issue new bonds at desirable rates. When a bond's price drops due to uncertain conditions, the payout remains the same, but new bonds may need to offer higher rates to attract buyers. While it is possible for a government or company to buy their own bonds to bolster the market, this may not be practical if they are issuing bonds to raise cash they do not have. In some cases, governments may use policies such as Quantitative Easing to address economic conditions beyond the goal of keeping bond prices up."}

However, it is crucial to understand which company benefits the most (or which is hurt the most) by the merger before making a play.\n\nIn some cases, the company being acquired will see a bounce, while the acquiring firm takes a hit.

As a point of reference, California's state franchise tax starts at $800 per year. Although forming an LLC in a state like Nevada or Delaware may seem tempting due to their lack of franchise tax and lower filing fees, it may not be worthwhile considering the extra expenses involved with hiring a Registered Agent to act as your permanent mailing address in that state. Moreover, California may still charge you the $800 franchise tax despite your LLC being established in another state. While it's possible to dispute their claim, the hassle may not be worth it."}

{"2832": "\n\nPersonally, I use a checkbook program to manage my spending and account balance. As with most people, I have recurring bills, such as the mortgage, insurance, and car payments, which I input into the program a month prior to their due dates. The program generates a transaction list showing the date, amount, and remaining balance. To determine my available funds, I identify the last transaction before my next payday and review the balance for that day. I keep a buffer amount of $1000 in my account to prevent overdrafts in case of errors when entering check amounts or missing some transactions. While I don't include electric or heating bills, I factor them into my calculations mentally as they fall within my cushion of funds. The program is designed by myself, but there are similar alternatives available in the market. I initially used a spreadsheet, which worked fine, but I developed this program to manage tax records for a small business that I run, even though it generates minimal income. Maintaining a ledger manually becomes cumbersome as payments are often entered out of sequence, making tracking the balance complicated. A computer program can easily sort transactions and calculate the balance efficiently."}

Unlike mutual funds, CITs are not required to distribute dividends but instead reinvest dividends automatically to increase the value of the fund. This means that the value of the fund grows rather than the number of shares, as with dividend reinvestment. \n\nRegarding the S&P 500 fund you mentioned, note that there are two indexes you could be referring to. If you don't make any new contributions, your fund should closely track the Total Return version for periods of three months or longer, minus the expense ratio. However, if you are adding contributions to the fund, comparing start and end balances is not sufficient. Instead, you will need to use the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), which can be calculated using the XIRR function in Excel/Google Sheets. \n\nWhile mutual funds are not strictly required to pay dividends, they are strongly incentivized to do so for tax purposes, and almost all of them do."}

However, in the context of personal finance, budgeting tends to focus primarily on expenses, given that revenue is often fixed or easily predictable, such as through a regular salary. Operating and capital budgets are two distinct categories of budgeting. An operating budget pertains to daily and essential expenses, including employee salaries and routine maintenance of infrastructure. Revenue is directly related to these expenses. Such budgets are typically completed within a single year. Capital budgets involve larger, longer-term expenditures, such as constructing a new bridge. Funding for these projects is often obtained from external sources, such as loans or other agencies. Revenue streams can vary and may be linked to the project's funding sources."}

Having said that, in general, an analyst conducts a thorough investigation of a company's historical performance, including operations within divisions of the company, product development cycles, expenses vs income trends for each division and product, marketing costs, and customer acquisition costs. They also gather information regarding the company's current and future plans through conversations with company principals, and establish a perspective on related macro-economic trends, sector and industry trends, demographic trends, etc. The analyst then combines all this information to forecast a change in revenues, margins, free cash flow, dividends, etc. over a period of time. After that, they apply statistics that relate these figures to stock prices, in order to predict stock prices and price ranges over the same periods. Finally, depending on how those stock prices compare to the current stock price, they will classify the stock as a Buy, Sell, Hold, etc.\n\nThis process can be quite elaborate, which is often the case for professionals and significant fund managers. However, there are many armchair analysts sharing their output on numerous financial platforms (such as Seeking Alpha and Motley Fool) for those who desire a more comprehensive analysis.

However, $1100 of this is made up of salable hours, which someone is willing to pay for, making it possible to calculate. If you and your spouse are splitting expenses \"fifty-fifty\", then you should contribute $1100 to match your spouse's contribution. It would make sense to put your part towards mutual expenses or save it for future expenses such as extra clothes, replacements for damaged items, or educational opportunities. If your family is a priority, consider investing half of your income towards it, matching your spouse's time investment in building the family. Any extra funds can be used for mutual expenses, future costs, or as savings for major expenses or security. \n\nYou could cover half your spouse's contribution, which would balance out monthly expenses and put her back in the green regarding her own expenses. However, running a household is equivalent to a 60-hour workweek, with an additional 100 hours of being \"on call,\" making it difficult to calculate the absolute minimum payment to match her time investment.\n\nAdditionally, rethinking your criteria for sharing income or dividing costs \"fairly\" may be necessary. Your job may be more stressful now, but raising a child is even more demanding. Raising a child is likely to require more time, money and anxiety than your education, so it's essential to balance your contributions.

While estimated category totals may suffice for budgeting or comparisons to prior periods, some expenses require accurate tracking, especially for income tax deductions or credits. \n\nFor instance, internet access and cable TV services are usually billed together, but only the former is tax-deductible for work-at-home web developers. Without split transaction capability, one may need to ignore the category difference, which introduces errors in the tracked data.

{"2847": "\n\nMy question is whether my credit score will be affected if my credit line is closed. The answer is that it will have some impact, but not as much as missing payments on outstanding debt or other bills. Unfortunately, there is not much you can do about it at this point, as reopening or opening a new account would likely require a credit check, which would further negatively affect your credit score. The best course of action is to focus on paying all your bills on time, which is the most significant factor in improving your credit score. \n\nReaching out to creditors or credit score companies may not be productive in this situation. The closing of your account may be seen as a neutral event, which will still have some negative impact but not as severe as bankruptcy or collections. To recover, keep your credit utilization under 30% and pay all bills and debt payments on time. \n\nFinding new employment should be your top priority, as this will enable you to make timely payments.

Short-term price fluctuations in the market do not necessarily reflect a company's future value, as short-term trends are often based on popularity rather than long-term performance. Instead, the crucial metric to consider is a company's free cash flow and related measurements. Focusing excessively on short-term price movements involves more speculation than strategic investment. Setting expectations for a tenfold increase within two to three years is unrealistic, as such growth is unusual. Most investors would be content with double the value in that timeframe. If I were in your position, I would purchase the stock and monitor the company's performance. Adding to the position as the stock price and management meet my expectations would be a wise course, as would diversifying with index funds. Assuming everything goes perfectly, the stock's expected value in two to three years would result in a marginal gain of $1,000. However, working a humble job and depositing 10% of your earnings into a savings account would provide a better rate of return ($6-9,000).

To overcome this problem, any coupon payments earned during the transaction belong to the legal owner or borrower. Nevertheless, the original owner is paid a cash amount that equals the coupon, referred to as the \"manufactured payment.\" Some institutions may repo the security to a tax-exempt entity to avoid taxes on coupon payments, a practice called \"coupon washing.\" Throughout the transaction's life, the seller remains responsible for the collateral's market risk and credit risk. If the security has a coupon payment during the life of the repo, the buyer must pay the seller according to the trade's documented terms."}
{"2874": "\n\n\nI have an affinity for both precious metals and real estate. However, given your stated timeframe and the impact of QE on precious metals, it may not be wise to invest in physical silver for the short term. Instead, consider exploring an ETF that shorts silver if you anticipate a decrease in its value as QE is reduced.\n\nAs for real estate, there are several ways to generate a profit within your timeframe. One option is to purchase a rental property for around $120,000 and take out a 20% mortgage. In 3-7 years, you can refinance and pull out the equity. If you don't require cash for your dream home purchase, consider finding a rental property that pays for itself and yields additional income, then arrange an 80% mortgage. Alternatively, let your money earn even more money by approaching your local mortgage broker about third-party or private lending. If you feel comfortable with this option, you can choose to participate in different deals presented to you. Keep in mind that as a second-position mortgage, there's a risk of not getting your principal back if the borrower goes bankrupt. However, this type of lending can offer short loan amortizations of 6 months to 5 years and higher rates than regular bank mortgages."}
{"2875": "\n\nI believe that some derivative markets may operate similarly to futures trading. In a futures contract, two parties agree to buy or sell an underlying security, and leverage is created because the margin posted is typically not enough to cover the collateral in the underlying contract. The buyer is essentially borrowing money, while the seller is lending money. These contracts usually have a short-term duration, and a lender of funds who is perfectly hedged should expect to receive a return similar to the fed funds rate in the US, which is currently negligible."}

It may take some time to break even after refinancing, so you must decide whether you plan to sell your property before that point or not. If you break even next year, then refinancing would be a no-brainer. As others have mentioned, it's important to do your calculations."}

In the context of LLCs, equity represents membership, and as a member, you will receive distributions and a K-1 form for tax purposes, rather than a 1099 or W2. If the CEO intends to provide you with a 1099, it implies that you will be hired as a contractor, which contradicts the idea of equity allocation. This is an entirely different situation. \n\nRegarding your specific questions: \n\n1. The use of the 1099-MISC form would depend on the type of payment being made. Depending on which box is checked, the payment may be considered employment income (subject to SE taxes) or passive income (such as royalties or rent, which are subject to various limitations in the tax code).\n\n2. If receiving a percentage of real estate sales is the only feasible method of compensation, it would likely be considered a commission and taxed as employment income. I strongly recommend consulting with a tax professional to determine the best course of action, taking into account the specific details, figures, and deals involved. It is crucial to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of being classified as a contractor versus an LLC member or employee, as each has its advantages and disadvantages. \n\n3.

{"2879": "\n\nDrawing a diagram is the key to solving most questions of this type. A diagram provides a visual representation of the timing of payments received and paid out. Once all payments are brought to the same date and equated to each other using the desired rate of return, the equation can be solved. For example, using the start of the bond's life as the reference point, the pay-out is X and the received payments include 15 annual payments of $70, with the first payment due in one year. The present value of an ordinary annuity formula can be used to bring this to the reference date. Additionally, a single payment of $1000 will be received 15 years in the future, which can be brought to the reference date using the simple interest formula. To solve for X, equate the pay-out to the present value of the received payments. It is unclear whether \"current rate\" and \"rate to maturity\" differ. Finding the interest rate for a series of payments follows a similar process, but solving for the interest rate would be challenging."}

{"2881": "\n\nMy son, who is now 21, has never required my cosigning on a loan, nor did he need to establish any credit rating to establish his own credit. One recommendation I have is to switch from a bank to a credit union. I have been using one for years, and as soon as my son got his first job, I opened an account for him there. Although his debit card doesn't build credit scores, it helps his account work with the credit union. What's more, he was able to get his first credit card through the credit union without the bureaucratic hassle of dealing with a large bank, despite his lack of credit score initially causing a somewhat higher interest rate. However, the rate wasn't a big issue since we taught him about finance, so he doesn't carry a balance. Moreover, he secured a student loan and didn't require a cosigner, enabling him to pursue higher education. The notion that one must establish a credit rating before adulthood is a myth. Much like my son, I established my credit on my own and never needed a cosigner to obtain my first credit card at 17, my first car at 18, or my first home at 22. Knowledge about using credit responsibly was always more crucial than having an early credit score. Before your children turn 18, opening credit accounts with them as the primary account holder could be problematic, as they are not liable for the debt legally. Using them as a cosigner is also problematic for the same reason. Since each financial institution has its own rules, and am not fully aware of them all, I would suggest a small line of credit with a credit union for your proposal. Since they are small and locally controlled, you will probably have better success there."}
{"2882": "\n\nWhy are there so many stock exchanges in the world? While the simple answer is that facilitating the trading of securities generates significant profits, there are other factors contributing to the proliferation of exchanges that relate to advancements in technology. In recent years, trading volumes have ballooned, with the number of shares traded on US exchanges surging from 6.5 billion in 1997 to 40.8 billion in 2015. This increase can be attributed largely to new technologies supporting high-volume, high-frequency trading methods. The surge in activity has led to an increase in the number of stock exchanges, though consolidation of ownership among legacy exchanges (such as the NYSE and Euronext) has also occurred. On the other hand, the creation of virtual exchanges (known as Alternative Trading Systems in North America and Multilateral Trading Facilities in Europe) has significantly eroded volumes on legacy exchanges, with total shares traded on such traditional exchanges peaking in 2008 and declining since then. According to SEC data, in 2012, Alternative Trading Systems accounted for 11.3% of total trading volume, and that proportion has no doubt grown since then. The loss of business to these virtual exchanges has prompted consolidation of legacy exchanges, but these new exchanges must also adhere to the same regulatory requirements as traditional exchanges."}

Therefore, you will need to file the appropriate personal tax forms in the U.S. as well as in potentially one or more states. It is important to note that the U.S. government does not register LLCs; rather, registration occurs at the state level, such as in Oregon, Wisconsin, or Wyoming. Additionally, you will need to have a registered agent in the state, which is significant because the main purpose of forming an LLC is to add a liability shield.

However, there is a key exception: if money is taxed by the U.S., it may also be taxed by a state.

Generally, states will tax income made within their borders. For instance, it is common to have a Wyoming LLC that never pays any taxes in Wyoming. \n\nIf you plan to do business in a state where you did not form the LLC, you must register as a \"foreign LLC,\" even though you are still in the United States.

{"2893": "\n\nI am considering trading in my car, but I need advice on how to get the best deal. Gathering information is crucial to ensure the best possible outcome. Therefore, it is recommended to seek a second opinion on the repairs, as a misfire may have a variety of causes, ranging from inexpensive (bad spark plugs or cables) to mid-range (timing issue) to costly (engine rebuild due to mechanical problems causing improper cylinder compression). Furthermore, car diagnostics are not always precise, so it is beneficial to consult with another mechanic. Seeking additional opinions does not reflect a lack of trust in the initial service provider, but rather an awareness that humans and car repair diagnostics are fallible. Once you obtain quotes from several mechanics for the repair work, you can effectively negotiate. The subsequent step is to understand the cost of replacing the vehicle by obtaining trade-in quotes from dealers and disclosing engine concerns. Subtracting this amount from $8,000 reveals how much you owe on the car. You can then tack this onto the purchase price of your new vehicle to determine how much of a loan you require. Think about how to manage your risk post-purchase. Does your new car require additional collateral or gap insurance? What happens in the event of an accident? Consider factors like the automobile's reliability and maintenance history before making a decision. If you opt to maintain the car, attempt to obtain a favourable price by checking out other repair shops. However, if you choose to purchase a new vehicle and dispose of the HHR, both the sale and trade-in prices are negotiable.

{"2894": "\n\nWhy can't two companies exchange goods directly without paying VAT? While this would eliminate the famous carousel fraud scam and avoid complicated refunds, it is not feasible. In the United States, sales tax only applies to end customers, not businesses that collect sales tax. However, this creates opportunities for criminal businesses to charge tax and keep the proceeds without reporting it or evading income tax. Additionally, cross-jurisdiction taxes such as internet sales often go untaxed. \n\nThe purpose of a Value Added Tax (VAT) is to charge at each level, allowing each buyer to report the tax paid to the seller to deduct it. The seller must pay the charged VAT, or the tax authorities will revoke their VAT license. Under a system where only the end user is taxed, fraud is easier compared to VAT. The fraudulent business can collect tax from the end user and disappear, or not record those transactions - resulting in straight up tax fraud. The complexity of carousel fraud arises because evading VAT is difficult."}

{"2907": "\n\nLet me attempt to clarify: The reason why parabolas are relevant to stock prices is because they are flat at the bottom. In the Black Scholes model, the variance of the log stock price is proportional to the time until expiration. This means that the standard deviation of the log stock price is proportional to the square root of time. For normally distributed random variables, we expect to be within one standard deviation about 68% of the time.  Therefore, we expect the log stock price to be within a certain range that depends on the square root of time. For example, if the stock's volatility is 16%, we can expect its price to be within a certain range over different time periods. This range shrinks as the expiration date approaches, following a sideways parabolic curve. As we get closer to zero, the slope of the curve becomes steeper and steeper. This can be expressed using the traders' rule of thumb that the value of an at-the-money option is approximately equal to S * 0.4 * vol * sqrt(T), where T is the time until expiration."}

As a result, housing loans are cheaper in India, offered at around 10%, which is lower than the 15% rate applied to most other assets. Additionally, since housing loans can be deducted against tax, the effective interest rate is even lower. However, despite these benefits, housing in India is still unaffordable for many.

If the notification is not given within the allowed window, the dealer may have to refund the entire down payment. However, if the bank refuses the loan, negotiation with the dealer may not bring the desired result, and it may be best to seek other financing options from personal banks or credit unions.

{"2910": "\n\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, credit is just as important for wealthy individuals as it is for the less affluent. Contrary to what some may believe, rich people often don't keep significant amounts of cash on hand. Instead, most of their assets are tied up in safe, long-term investments that are not easily liquidated. This is why credit is key for covering their day-to-day expenses. They pay off these expenses using dividends from their investments, which may only come in once every quarter. \n\nHowever, credit isn't just a convenient way to cover expenses. It can also be advantageous from a tax perspective. For example, if a wealthy individual needs a new car, leasing it for their business can provide an immediate write-off of the lease payments on taxes, unlike purchasing the car outright, which can accrue depreciation over several years and property tax liability in certain states. \n\nAnother way that wealthy individuals use credit is to safeguard their personal finances when taking on business ventures. For instance, instead of using all of their personal funds to buy a business costing one million dollars, they may use a much smaller amount of their own money and take out a loan from a bank for the remaining amount. This way, if the business fails, the bank is left to cover the debt, while the wealthy individual is only out the personal funds they put in. With careful debt management and sound financial planning, the risk can even be reduced to zero. \n\nIn summary, while it may not be immediately apparent, credit is a vital component of financial management, regardless of an individual's wealth status. By leveraging credit effectively, rich individuals can not only maintain their liquidity, but also optimize their tax status and minimize risk when taking on investment opportunities."}

{"2918": "\n\nWhile the law does not mandate having a separate bank account for your business or require that you pay all expenses from a business bank account, it is highly advisable to do so. By having a dedicated business account and paying business expenses from it, you streamline your accounting processes and create clear distinctions between your business and personal finances, which can be especially helpful during an audit. It's worth noting that the account used to pay for a particular expense doesn't impact whether that expense is ultimately deductible as a business expense. For instance, if you pay for advertising from your personal account, it can still be considered as a deductible business expense. Conversely, if you use your business account to purchase groceries, it is unlikely that this expense will be considered deductible. It's worth noting that various rules define when and how much travel expenses are deductible, so be sure to investigate the specific guidelines that apply in your case."}
{"2919": "\n\nRevised: Dutch law provides tax exemption for income generated from a hobby, but certain rules must be followed to qualify. One criterion is the amount of time spent on the activity, as well as whether the hourly wage is low. Having a boss typically indicates that the activity is not a hobby. A prime example is creating and selling dolls at a crafts fair. If someone sells at fairs all over the country each weekend, then it is a considerable time commitment and no longer considered a hobby. However, selling only at local fairs would qualify as a hobby. Situation 3 poses the most difficulty since it involves luck versus work. If someone obtained income luckily, then it is still viewed as a hobby. However, if someone spends a significant amount of time trading in-game to increase the value of their holdings, then it is seen as a job, and the income must be reported accordingly as \"income from other sources, not yet taxed.\" Actual expenses can be deducted while determining income from a hobby. In the case of a net income of -$1000, this is not unusual for a hobby, and the same applies if someone were to purchase and sell a horse at a loss after deciding not to pursue horse riding."}

While I disagree with the \"cash or bust\" answers mentioned earlier, the information provided is still valuable and I do not intend to discredit it. To illustrate my point, let's examine two scenarios. Option 1 involves investing $100k in the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) in early 2007 and holding it until now. The lowest balance would have been around $51k, with the possibility of job loss looming. The current value would be $170k assuming no withdrawals. On the other hand, Option 2 involves adopting a risk parity approach by investing 50% in the Consumer Staples Sector ETF (XLP) and 50% in the Long Term Treasury ETF (TLT). The low point would have been $88k with the lowest annual return being +0.69%. Today, the investment would be worth $214k assuming no withdrawals. I selected Option 2, which has been a reliable investment strategy for me even in 2016. My philosophy is to always grow my wealth while taking necessary precautions for potential risks. This approach has been backtested using portfoliovisualizer.com; however, it is important to recognize the risks associated with inflation and a lack of international exposure."}

{"2930": "What is the primary factor that prevents consumers from being as willing to pay fees as businesses do? Power. Similarly, what prevents individuals from being able to impose penalties or fines on businesses? It is a matter of power. Even if individuals could impose penalties, the cost would likely be high, and it would not be motivated by a desire for money, but rather principle. Unfortunately, individuals do not have a legal entitlement to receive money back from businesses. They could ask for compensation, but unless there is a signed contract agreeing to pay, businesses do not have to comply. Similarly, corporations cannot arbitrarily impose fees or fines on customers. Either customers had agreed to pay previously or they agree now in exchange for something. In both cases, the power rests on the side of the corporations, where customers must accept their rules to participate.\n\nHowever, customers also have a significant amount of power, particularly in well-competed markets. They can choose to do business with someone else if they do not like the fees. For instance, customers could avoid a restocking fee by shopping on Amazon, where returns are free. Or, find a doctor without a no-show fee, or one whose caseload is lower, making it easier to schedule appointments without having to do it far in advance. The power to fine businesses lies in the power of choosing not to patronize them. In some markets, though, customers have little power, such as in cable television (or other utilities). The FCC has established Customer Service Standards that cable companies must comply with, and many states have additional rules that impose more severe penalties for late or missed appointments.\n\nAdditionally, if a doctor is late, customers can choose to find another doctor who is not. Or, customers could opt to send the doctor a bill for their wasted time, which has worked in some cases, particularly if the doctor seeks to retain the customer's business."}

Financial disagreements can be a common source of conflict and even divorce for many couples. Different spending priorities, especially when financial resources are limited, can exacerbate these disagreements. Our solution is a weekly allowance system. Firstly, we pool all our money and consider it shared between us. While this can be a challenging step for some couples, I trust and share my life with my spouse, so sharing my finances seemed natural. We then establish an allowance that we each receive to cover non-joint expenses, such as clothing, dining out, and hobbies. We determined the amount based on our previous spending, and adjust it annually. Criticizing each other's spending is not allowed, so we are free to use the money as we please. We have implemented this system for the last 23 years, and have found it to be a successful way to manage our finances and avoid financial fights. One downside is that it requires some effort to track expenses. We use an accounting system to plan our expenses and income at least one year in advance, allowing us to identify potential cash flow problems or areas where we can cut back.

Even though you won't get paid for almost a month, you have still earned this amount, making it accrued. However, if you do not receive payment, it becomes bad debt, which you can write off after you can prove the payee's inability to pay.

Checking the financial statements for this will indicate. Secondly, a company may borrow money to pay shareholders as dividends. Thirdly, it might sell some of its assets and distribute the gains as dividends. Lastly, a company might get acquired by another one which then pays shareholders to keep them pleased. It is vital to monitor the financial statements to determine how much liquid cash a company has to pay shareholders. The decision to pay dividends still rests on the company, and they can stop it whenever they want. For instance, Steve Jobs did not pay dividends at Apple, although they made billions in profits. Some companies prefer to reinvest in their business instead of paying dividends to shareholders."}

The size of an economy and its money supply are the primary factors that influence a currency's value.

{"2948": "\n\nYou may have to pay a higher cost for stocks on tax-free dividend exchanges. For instance, HSBC on the NYSE has a 4.71% yield while HSBC on the LSE has only a 4.56% yield. Assuming the shares are identical, the prices differ from market fluctuations if the UK taxes are more favorable than those in the US. Consequently, the demand for HSBC on the LSE increases, raising the price and lowering the yield by 0.15%. The significance of the yield difference depends on the dividend tax, with a 30% and 0% tax rate. If your country has a foreign tax credit, like the US, the 30% return is delayed until your tax return, making the choice of which exchange to buy on less clear cut. However, if your country doesn't have this tax credit, it's advisable to purchase stocks on an exchange without dividend tax.

{"2952": "\n\nI highly recommend watching Swenson's enlightening lecture series in which he identifies three sources of returns: diversification, timing, and selection. While he appears to dismiss timing and selection, a student challenges him on this point. It is revealed that Yale has indeed timed the market by shorting .com stocks before the bubble burst and real estate just before the downturn. In 1990, Yale established an \"Absolute Return\" unit and allocated around 15 percent of its portfolio to it by selling US equities. This unit specializes in hedging strategies similar to the ones described above. To reduce costs, Yale hires internal managers for specific areas. This is because Wall Street charges high expense ratios that would represent a sizable salary when applied to Yale's multi-billion-dollar portfolio. Furthermore, selling off assets to maintain ratios requires specialized knowledge. In some cases, it is not feasible to invest without management. For instance, Yale has a significant allocation in private equity, which is not traded on the open market. Despite diversification efforts, Yale lost 25 percent of its portfolio in 2009.

{"2954": "\n\nI have some additional points to add to the excellent responses provided by JoeTaxpayer and littleadv. While a decedent's estate can be named as the beneficiary of an IRA, a testamentary trust cannot. Instead, a testamentary trust can serve as a pass-through entity that receives distributions from the IRA and distributes them to beneficiaries, provided it meets certain requirements outlined in Publication 590. For minors named as beneficiaries, the trust must disperse any IRA distributions to the legal guardians or other custodians of the minors' UTMA accounts, who are responsible for investing the funds for the minors' benefit. However, the funds cannot be used for the legal guardians' living expenses, except as allowed under UTMA regulations. Once the minors become adults, they receive all the accumulated value of their UTMA accounts and are free to use the funds, including taking RMDs. The main advantage of the testamentary trust is that it allows the trustee to decide how much money beyond the RMD is distributed each year. However, the amount of discretion allowed should be carefully considered. Regardless of whether the Traditional IRA goes directly to beneficiaries or through a testamentary trust, the value of the IRA is still included in the estate and may be subject to estate tax. Beneficiaries may deduct the portion of the estate tax paid from the income tax they owe on IRA withdrawals. Estate planning is a highly complex area, and even lawyers experienced in estate and trust matters may struggle with aspects of tax law, like income tax law."}

{"2957": "\n\nThe Ex-Date is a factor determined by both the exchange and the dividend. To illustrate, let's consider Deutsche Bank AG, which is registered under different tickers: DB on NYSE and DKR on Xetra. The Ex-Date for trades on each exchange is determined by its respective dividend. The SEC website provides a description of how this process works in the US, which is similar to other exchanges in different countries. Typically, the Ex-Date is established based on the record date of the dividend, when a shareholder must be listed on the company's books to receive their payout. The Ex-Date is then set to allow enough time for the exchange trades to settle. Since the same dividend may have different Ex-Dates for different exchanges, it's important to check the time zone of each exchange. The majority of stock exchanges operate on a T+3 schedule, but the presence of public holidays in different countries and at different times may impact the settlement process. Investors must be cautious as selling shares before or on the Ex-Date of an exchange means missing out on the dividend."}

In the given scenario, the majority of the benefits came from dividends, leaving less potential for an increase in company valuation.

Such reinvestment could result in lower dividends but potentially higher stock valuations. The decision to pay dividends still benefits investors, but it may keep share prices comparatively low."}

One option is for one person to operate as a sole proprietorship, while the other acts as a contractor who receives 50% of profits. This arrangement should be put in writing, along with other important matters. The owner of the sole proprietorship may be eligible to deduct certain business expenses while the contractor would receive a 1099 tax form for their share of revenues. Setting up a partnership or S-Corp in which both parties are 50% owners is another option, which requires the necessary legal paperwork. Alternatively, an LLC can be established in any of the aforementioned structures. It is important to consider the added cost of tax preparation, which can total around $600 per year, before choosing a tax structure. In any case, the first step is to apply for an EIN and open a business bank account. Good luck with the new venture!"}

While these asset classes may be inversely correlated at times (e.g., when stocks go down, bonds may go up), a good starting point for a young investor, in their 30s, is to allocate 80% to stocks and 20% to bonds. Some suggest using the rule of thumb '110 minus your age' to determine the stock allocation percentage. \n\nRebalancing is necessary when the asset allocation (AA) deviates from the target allocation by more than 3% to 5%. For example, if a recent increase in the stock market causes the AA to become 85% stocks and 15% bonds, you would sell some stocks and buy more bonds to rebalance back to the target allocation of 80% stocks and 20% bonds. This technique benefits from the age-old principle of buying low and selling high, as it involves selling the investments that have performed well and buying those that have lagged behind.\n\nTo achieve diversification within your stocks portfolio, investing in the S&P 500 index is a good start.

However, having a wad of cash can simplify the process of obtaining a car, apartment or bank account. Nevertheless, establishing credit through a secured credit card is easily achievable and can be beneficial for utility bills and job opportunities.

{"2976": "\n\nThere are two esoteric differences that are related to the same cause. When you have an outstanding debit balance in a margin, your broker may lend out your securities to short sellers. They may also be able to lend them out even if there is no debit balance, so it is important to check your account agreement and relevant regulations. However, you may never know this unless you ask, and even then, there may be no indication in your account. In the event that the securities pay out dividends while being lent out, you will not receive the dividends directly. Instead, the dividends will go to the person who bought them from the short-seller. The short-seller will then have to pay the dividend amount to their broker, who will in turn pay it to your broker, who finally pays it to you. If the security's dividends were qualified dividends (15% max rate), the qualified-ness will go to the person who bought the security from the short-seller. Unfortunately, what you receive will not be dividends, but rather a payment-in-lieu of dividends, and qualified dividend treatment will not be available for them. However, some brokers may offer you a gross-up payment to compensate for the additional tax you would have had to pay for the loss of your qualified dividends. \n\nSimilarly, if there is a shareholder vote, and the stock was lent out on the record date to establish voting eligibility, the person eligible to vote is the person who bought them from the short-seller, not you. Therefore, if you want or need to vote in a shareholder vote, you should contact your broker and ask them to journal the shares in question over to the cash side of your account before the record date for determining voting eligibility."}

If one is comfortable with that level of financial loss, then they probably aren't too concerned with the 27K investment value over the 30K loan at 0.9%. However, I think this sets a bad example. Many people consider car payments a necessary evil, but it can be a tough habit to break once you have one. There's a psychological advantage to driving a paid-for car that could lead to increased earnings.

{"2985": "\n\nBloomberg has reported that two Fidelity funds currently hold preferred shares of Snapchat Inc. Unlike ordinary stocks, preferred shares have characteristics that more closely resemble bonds, such as a fixed dividend, lower liquidity, and non-voting rights. Due to their lower liquidity, these shares are typically not traded on the market. While it is perfectly legal for a company to hold a non-marketable interest in another company, such as Snapchat, the funds' strategy documents may restrict ownership of illiquid assets or limit the percentage of assets held in such instruments. Nonetheless, these funds are an attractive option for start-ups seeking funding, as they provide a low-cost way for investors to directly invest in new companies before they go through the expensive process of an initial public offering (IPO). These funds deal directly with company owners to purchase shares, which are then marked to market (MTM) to reflect their fair value. The recent markdown of Snapchat's stock value by Fidelity likely reflects a calculated decrease in the net present value (NPV) of the company's assets, possibly due to a lack of revenue streams coming into the business. Additionally, it should be noted that there is no market for start-up stocks pre-IPO."}

A comprehensive list of these standards can be found on Wikipedia under Cyber Security Standards. However, depending on the geographic location, there might be additional local government requirements regarding reporting issues and data security.\n\nIt is essential to differentiate between fraudulent customers and attackers on a bank's infrastructure. Fraudulent customers or those that have been compromised by third parties can be identified through credit scores and merchant databases, as well as data from firms specialized in Fraud Prevention. On the other hand, attackers who intend to steal, manipulate or spy on data can be identified, prevented, and recorded using IDS solutions and attacker databases. For firms that receive compensation from insurance, compliance with the law and maintaining records is crucial. Therefore, they focus more on recording data to backtrack attackers than preventing attacks.\n\nFor customers, the most important things to consider are local laws and deposit insurance. Banks are insured and typically compensate customers for money theft. Authentication methods, such as PIN/TAN, are crucial but standard. These authentication methods consist of one password and one offline part, such as a TAN from a paper letter or an RSA generator or card reader.\n\nTo summarize, financial institutions must comply with local laws and meet international standards. Banks use highly advanced intrusion detection and fraud prevention, which is logically based on databases. For the average customer, there is seldom a high risk of losing deposits even if the attacker gains full access to the bank account. However, this depends on the country you reside in. In the case of targeted attacks, additional security measures may need to be implemented."}
{"2987": "There are many excellent tactical points in the previous answers, but I'd like to focus on two strategic points to consider in your five-year plan. Both of them involve diversification. \n\nExpense allocation: You have several potential expenses, or rather, \"applications\" for your money. Consider your finances as a resource that you can allocate into multiple \"buckets\" based on time horizon and risk tolerance. Start with an ultra-short-term cushion for extreme emergencies that you can access at a moment's notice from a bank account. A short-term cushion for emergencies follows, best fulfilled by a CD ladder that offers better interest rates and quick access to your funds. For long-term savings, consider an investment account with low-index funds that offer better returns than savings accounts or CDs but require more risk tolerance. Retirement savings are also critical; you should consider an IRA or 401k, with the latter available through a job. Prioritize these expenses as mentioned above and ensure that you have enough money in short-term cushions to be 99% confident. \n\nIncome: Consider your expected net income (after living expenses) for the next few years as you allocate your savings. Factors such as your health, marital status, career goals, and job stability could all impact your financial plans. Determine whether short-term or long-term savings are more important based on these factors. \n\nThere is no one perfect way to allocate your money, so be wise and give yourself a good head start in your personal finances. Best of luck!"}
{"2988": "\n\nHave you considered whether your mother-in-law is contributing to the cost of housing or whether she is renting from you? This is important to factor into your financial calculations. If you were to start a business, you would need to declare such expenses on your business taxes, which would also count as income for your mother-in-law and require her to file taxes accordingly, both state and federal taxes. For instance, if your mother-in-law ran the business, she could deduct expenses like diapers as a business expense. However, if you ran the business, it would significantly complicate tax matters as your business expenses would be covering your personal expenses. Furthermore, regardless of your work situation, there would still be a diaper expense to pay. \n\nTo qualify for the tax credit, you must report relevant details like the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the care provider on your tax return, using Form W-10 (PDF) to request this information from the provider. If you cannot obtain this information, you may still qualify for the credit by demonstrating that you made a good-faith effort to provide it. Note, however, that the IRS will look for an income tax form from your mother-in-law that claims the income, and attempting to \"game the system\" by starting a business solely to save on taxes might trigger an audit. Filing for the credit complexly, based on your household's adjusted gross income, could lead to higher taxes for your mother-in-law.

Although $0.08 multiplied by 4 equals $0.32, which only amounts to a 3.9% yield, this stock pays dividends every month. However, if you multiply $0.08 by 12 months, you get $0.96, which equates to an 11.9% yield. Therefore, if the stock price and dividends remain unchanged throughout the year, you stand to earn an 11.9% return."}
{"2993": "\n\nIs it worthwhile to invest in stocks with a 2-3% average yield? The average yield is skewed by stocks in the S&P500 index that do not pay dividends or have such low yields that they are not worth considering. Thus, when building an investment portfolio by contributing $2k-$3k/month, the immediate yield is not the best measure of dividends or other investments. Rather, income investors should focus on YOC (Yield On Cost), which measures the income received in a year based on the purchase price of the asset generating that income. \n\nFor dividend growth investing, investors must pick the right companies based on several criteria, such as long-term EPS and dividend growth rates, low debt/cashflow ratio, good moat, etc. They should buy only on dips or downtrends, where the price causes a higher yield and lower than normal P/E, and have faith that they've valued the company correctly for a 3+ year or longer hold time. It's not unheard of to build up a $20k+ dividend payment portfolio in less than 10 years. \n\nIncome is not just for the elderly. Some people have achieved financial independence by building up an income portfolio that covers their expenses. To this end, it's important to determine whether stock assets that pay dividends or other investment opportunities resonate with individual preferences, risk tolerance, and liquidity concerns. For example, post-tax stock accounts are more liquid than a real estate portfolio, depending on personal circumstances."}

{"2995": "\n\nThe media frequently reports on the US central bank stopping the flow of \"cheap money\", but what exactly does this mean and how will it impact the stock market? An interest rate can be thought of as the cost of borrowing money, and if it is considered cheap, it implies that the interest rate is lower than what is typically expected. Comparing it to a cheap price of milk, it's important to note that the low cost of money is relative to past prices or that of competitors' rates.\n\nIt is inaccurate to assume that the value of the dollar will decrease simply because the supply of dollars has increased. The value or price of the dollar is determined by both the supply and demand for it. If the demand for dollars outweighs the supply, the price will increase, as we have recently seen in the value of the dollar compared to other foreign currencies and commodities like gold.\n\nWhen cheap money ends, the value of the dollar and interest rates will likely rise. This could slow down the economy and make it more difficult for companies to generate profits, leading to a decline in earnings. Furthermore, those who rely heavily on cheap borrowing (such as REITs) could face financial difficulties and even bankruptcy.\n\nIn summary, the end of cheap money will likely have far-reaching consequences, but predicting the exact outcome is difficult. It's essential to observe the current market trends to understand what may happen in the future."}
{"2996": "You have asked multiple questions, so to answer them effectively, I will provide an overview of risk-neutral pricing. The physical probability of an event occurring, such as stock prices rising, is intuitive but cannot be used to determine an asset's value, as price is not the weighted average of future outcomes. For instance, a risky stock with a 50% chance of being worth $20 tomorrow and 50% chance of being worth $10 does not have a value of $15 today, as it must earn a premium due to the risk involved. To calculate the value of an asset through physical probabilities, you must take the probability-weighted average of all its possible prices tomorrow and add in compensation for risk. \n\nInstead of using physical probabilities, finance theory proposes creating \"risk-neutral probabilities\" by adjusting the probability of good market outcomes down and increasing the probability of bad outcomes. This approach enables the pricing of all assets, such as equity, options, bonds, and savings accounts, by multiplying each outcome by its risk-neutral probability and discounting at the risk-free rate. Although these probabilities are not physical, they consistently provide the correct price for every asset without requiring a risk premium.\n\nTo calculate risk-neutral probabilities, we use prices instead of researching the likelihood of a stock rising or falling. For example, if a stock has two potential prices tomorrow, U and D, and the risk-neutral probability of U is q, then the price can be calculated using the formula [ Uq + D(1-q) ] / e^(rt), with e^(rt) representing discounting by the risk-free rate. The risk-neutral probability of the stock going up can be solved for using this equation, which is useful in pricing associated options. To determine the option's price, we use the stock's risk-neutral probability, its known values if it moves up or down, and discount it at the risk-free rate. In conclusion, using the same risk-neutral probability measure, we can price all assets by multiplying each outcome with its risk-neutral probability and discounting it at the risk-free rate."}

{"2998": "\n\nI'm not confident that your categorization of funds as \"direct\" and \"regular\" accurately describes the mutual fund industry. The funds themselves are not inherently \"direct\" or \"regular.\" Rather, it depends on how an investor chooses to invest in them. If you invest through your own brokerage account, it's considered a \"direct\" investment. If you hire a financial advisor to do it for you, it's considered \"regular.\" For a given fund, you have the option to invest directly or through an advisor. Additionally, many funds offer different share classes with different accessibility and fees. The institutional class, for example, may only be available through a 401(k). The premium class may require a minimum investment, and some classes have front-end or back-end loads. These share classes have different expense ratios and fees, all of which are publicly available in the fund's prospectus and other sources. It's true that funds with higher fees may earn less each year after fees, as you noted. \n\nOne important fee to be aware of is the 12b-1 fee.

Selling covered calls can be a good strategy, as it offers a way to generate gains without risking your stock being called away. If you do this within an IRA, you can avoid this risk altogether. Covered calls can lower your cost and create a fixed maximum gain, and they can be set up when buying a stock or after holding it for some time. An example of this is buying 1000 shares of MU at $8700 and selling a $7.50 call (Jan 12) for $3000. Your cost then becomes $5700, but you can sell it for $7500, resulting in a 32% return if called away. Doing this is less risky than just owning one risky stock. Buying calls during the tech bubble was both the best and worst decision made by some individuals. One set of trades saw a 50x increase in value, but it eventually ended at \"only\" triple. Many people left the bubble far worse off than they started. To avoid such outcomes, it's best to set things up so that only a certain amount is risked at any given time. Learning from the experience is key."}
{"3001": "\n\nI was hoping for some discussion on the price elasticity of demand. Andrey, your question needs some revision. It's important to note that increased prices don't necessarily mean increased profitability for a company. The quantity sold also plays a significant role and is often correlated to the price at which goods are sold. (Other factors such as competitor pricing are also relevant, but let's leave them aside for now.) To calculate a firm's net profit from sales, we can use the formula (Qty x Sale Price) - COGS - SG&A - taxes - other expenses. In this equation, COGS represents the cost of goods sold, SG&A represents sales, general and administrative costs (such as inventory maintenance), and other expenses include any miscellaneous costs incurred to make the sale. If all of these factors remain constant, rising prices will only lead to higher profits if there is no equivalent drop in quantity sold. However, prices may increase in response to rising COGS, SG&A, or other expenditures - this is particularly apparent in inflationary environments. In such cases, the supplying firm risks losing its profit margin if the quantity sold drops by more than the price increase."}
{"3002": "Diversification is essential in finance as it reduces risk without affecting expected returns. So, the answer to your question is a resounding \"yes\". However, let's delve into the details your question invites. Many mutual funds are already diversified, and if you invest in one, you'll likely gain a significant portion of the benefits of diversification. Consequently, owning a diverse array of funds depends on the type of funds you already have. Target-date funds, for instance, have a built-in investment strategy and require no additional diversification. If you have funds that cover all major asset classes, there may be no need to purchase other funds. Remember that picking a \"favorite fund\" initially is often a result of cognitive biases, and acting on such biases can be harmful in the long run.\n\nYour advisor's recommendations may not necessarily be based on sound finance theory, as some conventional investment adages such as shifting investments as you age are not empirically proven. However, the concept of diversification is well-established and verified in theory and practice. A fund with a consistently high performance history is not unusual nor means it will continue to outperform in the future. It's unwise to buy a fund based solely on its historical performance, as this is a cognitive bias that may lead to loss.\n\nRegarding purchasing multiple mutual funds as part of your diversification strategy, it depends on your portfolio's composition. Diversification across asset classes is crucial and easily achieved through a single fund, but including a few funds in your portfolio is necessary. Risky bonds, international funds, emerging markets, small caps, value (or growth) funds, and sector funds are some options to consider. However, diversifying across managers within the same asset class has no significant benefit. Fundamentally, diversification is essential, and its benefits cannot be overstated."}

In these situations, the seller is the one who profits. They rely on the hope that people have to run a successful business. However, actual business individuals don't obtain their trade from fliers on poles. They are already knowledgeable about every aspect of their company. They do not need to pay an exorbitant amount of money to any random person who claims to launch them. If you are considering such deals, it implies that you have the means to invest money but lack direction. While I cannot tell you how to spend your money, I can caution against investing in any ad that reads \"fantastic business opportunity.\" It's a common trap that should be avoided."}

The most critical factor to consider here is whether the car is worth having with little or no savings left, which is what you'll need to decide.\n\nMy personal preference is to always buy a slightly used car as I dislike taking loans and paying interests. Given the amount of money you currently have, the \"Buy-in-part\" option seems to be the best as it minimizes your interest liability. However, I would advise against it at the moment since having only \u00a34000 in savings is risky in case of unexpected expenses.\n\nRegarding interest, it depends on your budget and the total interest you're willing to pay. Ultimately, it's your money and you should decide how best to use it. You can explore good leasing deals or take a chance with the \u00a34000 savings if you're confident about your financial stability.\n\nLastly, depreciation of the car's value is hard to predict over the next 2-3 years. So, be cautious when making assumptions about the car's worth. Wishing you good luck with your decision."}

Contributions to a 529 plan are not tax-deductible, but earnings are generally not subject to federal or state tax when used for qualified education expenses. Some states offer additional tax benefits for contributions to their associated 529 plans. Contributions can be made on a regular or ad hoc basis, and accounts can be set up by other relatives. \n\n529 programs are available throughout most states, as well as some major mutual fund companies. Some plans even allow the investor to shift the risk level of investments to be more conservative as the beneficiary approaches high school.

This option may be worthwhile if the child will attend a state school, but may not be as beneficial for out-of-state or private universities. \n\nThe IRS limits the maximum annual contribution to a 529 plan, with any contribution exceeding the $14,000 annual gift limit eligible for ratable treatment over five years. This limit applies per beneficiary, and can be elected for multiple beneficiaries. \n\nAt the end of the education journey, excess funds in a 529 plan can be utilized for graduate school or, with payment of taxes and penalties, can be used towards other expenses such as a car.

{"3006": "\n\nThere are several ways to finance your company, including borrowing money through options such as credit cards, lines of credit, loans, mortgages, and home equity lines of credit. Alternatively, you can seek investors who will provide equity in exchange for a percentage of ownership and profits. Keep in mind that the profits may not necessarily correspond to the ownership percentage, especially if the investor is passive. Additionally, voting rights may not equate to ownership percentage. It's also possible to combine equity and debt financing, but it's important to determine whether the investor will personally guarantee the company's debt. This ultimately affects their risk and desired return on investment. Crowdfunding is another potential option, where supporters or customers contribute funds in exchange for product delivery. Consulting practices also use a retainer system. Good luck with your financing endeavors!"}
{"3007": "\n\nTypically, when fixed rates are lower than variable rates, it suggests that banks anticipate a future decrease in rates. However, it is important to consider fixed rates for varying periods, such as comparing 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year fixed rates. If the 3 and 5-year fixed rates are higher than the 1-year rate, this may indicate that rates will fall in the short term but increase within a year. If the 3-year rate is also low, it could indicate a longer-term economic downturn. Banks adjust their fixed rates based on their outlook on the economy to remain competitive. Since May 2011, the standard variable rate has decreased twice (in November and December) to 7.30%. Additionally, banks have further reduced fixed rates, indicating expected future cuts in variable rates. Best regards, Victor."}

{"3013": "\n\nWhen considering contributing to a 529 plan, the first factor for parents to consider is whether the state government manages a plan that offers a state income tax deduction. It is essential to review annual fees for the program before deciding on the state plan. However, for many, the state program may be the best option due to state tax deduction benefits. Unfortunately, California does not offer a state tax deduction for 529 plan contributions. Therefore, if the fees are not reasonable for a family, or if investing options are better elsewhere, they can choose another state's program or even select a nationwide plan unaffiliated with a state. One such option is Scholarshare, which is managed by TIAA-CREF, a reputable company that runs many pension and 403(b) funds for state and local governments, including teacher unions. The ScholarShare Investment Board is authorized by the state of California and oversees all activities of the state's 529 college investment plan. The program allows Californians to save for college by investing in tax-advantaged investments. After-tax contributions provide tax-deferred earnings, and disbursals for tuition and qualified expenses are federal and state tax-free. The ScholarShare Plan is managed by TIAA-CREF Tuition Financing, Inc., and the Investment Board is responsible for overseeing other scholarship programs such as the Governor's Scholarship Programs and California Memorial Scholarship Program. However, it is important to note that families should ensure they review plans from other states to confirm they accept outside contributions before selecting a plan."}
{"3014": "\n\nThe best advice I ever received was to categorize my savings into three types: 1) Retirement savings, which should be put away in 401-Ks and IRAs and solely used when I am no longer able to support myself financially. These funds should not be borrowed against or withdrawn in emergency situations, or to buy a house. 2) Catastrophic savings, which should be put aside in case of severe events, such as prolonged job loss, hospitalization, extended illness, loss of home, significant loss of transportation, or very large appliance damage. This money should not be spent on unnecessary luxuries, such as vacations or diamond rings. 3) Urgent, relatively small needs savings, which should be used for bills that arise unexpectedly, unforeseen shortfalls in my budget, and unexpected repairs, such as car or small appliance repairs, fines, and fees.\n\nTo adhere to this budget plan, I should allocate 10% of my income into each of the three categories of savings. This means that 30% of my income is already allocated before dividing up the remaining 70% intro fixed and variable expenses. Fixed expenses include bills I pay monthly, such as housing, utilities, car payments, and debt repayment, while variable expenses include discretionary items, such as eating out or splurging on gifts.\n\nAn important aspect of budgeting is partnering with someone who has a different financial attitude than you. If you are a saver, partner with a spender, and vice versa. Three budgeting rules should be followed: A) do not spend any money unless it is in the budget, B) the budget only includes items to which both parties agree, and C) the budget can be modified as needed during the pay period.\n\nIt is important to note that a budget should not be used as a means to fight with your partner. Instead, it is a flexible plan that should be adjusted to new information and events as they arise. Urgent need savings can be accessed if necessary. Lastly, it is essential to remember that budgeting should take into account all aspects of life, not just the present needs, but also future needs, such as children's birthdays, school fees, house maintenance, gifts to relatives, and unexpected events."}

It's crucial to do your research to find the best one for your needs. To assist you in your search, we have compiled a list of custodians to consider.\n\nHere are some of the benefits and drawbacks that we commonly observe in this industry. Self-directed IRAs offer the flexibility to invest in a wide range of assets that traditional securities do not cover, such as private company stock, tax liens, and even horses. Additionally, investors have greater control over their investments, as they can decide how assets like rental properties should operate. Lastly, self-directed IRAs enable you to invest in assets that you're familiar with, and that resonate with your expertise and interests.\n\nOn the other hand, some challenges come with self-directed IRAs. Illiquid investments can create problems if you need to access your capital through withdrawals. Additionally, prohibited transactions are more prevalent in this industry, which could be unfamiliar to investors not well-versed in these areas. Further, custodian and administrator fees associated with self-directed IRAs are often higher compared to traditional IRA fees. Lastly, fraudulent sponsors often target self-directed IRA owners, making it crucial to exercise caution when investing in these schemes.\n\nSelf-directed IRAs may not be the right choice for everyone, but they can help investors to focus on areas where they possess in-depth knowledge and experience.

Despite the fact that you have already begun, it is recommended that you have a proper consultation first hand. With regards to startup costs, you can typically claim up to $5000 in tax deductions in the first year of your business, while expenses exceeding that amount will be amortized over a span of 15 years, consistent with IRC Sec. 195. Keep in mind that amortization initiates when your business becomes active, which indicates that although you may purchase the property, you are unable to begin depreciating it until you open the restaurant. With regards to accounting, it is imperative to distinguish between start-up/organizational expenses; and capital asset purchases, as they should be capitalized differently. For example, purchasing commercial ovens, tables and silverware all categorize a capital asset purchase, which ought to be depreciated separately. Conversely, any salaries disbursed to employees are treated as a current expense and should not be capitalized.

To sum up, when people talk about \"high,\" \"low,\" or \"rising\" interest rates, they are generally referring to the prime lending rate conceptually.

In case you are paying 5-6%, you are more likely to earn less than the mortgage.\n\nOn the other hand, considering a security standpoint, taking a loan seems like a safer option. Investing one-third of your retirement savings into one purchase is a more considerable risk. On the other hand, a 10-15 year loan provides more flexibility. Additionally, if you do not outlive the mortgage, you would have used more of your retirement income than you would have without the loan. But, if you have to pay a significant medical bill, it might force you to liquidate your 403b. Hence, paying off the mortgage in advance might have some upsides.\n\nFurthermore, as @chili555 mentions in the comments, you should evaluate the taxation of your 403(b) income.

Additionally, many lack practical job experience which can negatively impact their financial decisions. Statistics related to student loans show that this demographic tends to make poor money decisions.

If you choose the monthly payment option, you'll be paying the full retail price over two years without interest, but at least you'll stay off contract. If you have a 16GB iPhone 5 or newer, you should be able to sell it on Craigslist for the deductible amount, which is a no-brainer to me. Once you receive the insurance replacement, you can sell the old phone when you're ready to upgrade. Since you can sell the phone, I think that the decision of paying off the $100 and starting payments on the new phone is not as important as comparing the value of the phone and the deductible."}
{"3041": "\n\nThe question regarding living in Florida while working remotely for a NY employer who withholds NYS taxes has arisen again. The previous answers were deemed insufficient by the poster on the updated version, prompting me to provide a new answer. If the arrangement is for the convenience of the employee, NYS taxes this income. However, if the arrangement is necessary to complete the work, no NYS tax applies. When the arrangement is for convenience, New York state taxes all New York-source salary and wage income of nonresident employees. This information is sourced from Laws of New York, \u00a7 601(e), 20 NYCRR 132.18, which can also be found in this article: http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2009/jun/20091371.html. Furthermore, TSB-M-06(5)I is the NYS tax document governing this situation. Although the page mentioned in the previous answer by @littleadv may initially suggest a different answer, the ruling in the tax memo indicates that if the employee is out of state only for convenience, the services were performed in NYS for NYS tax purposes. The memo states that any allowance claimed for days worked outside New York State must be based on the performance of services, which of necessity obligate the employee to out-of-state duties in the service of their employer."}
{"3042": "\n\nBobbyScon's response provides a good overview, but may not be specific enough. The first reason in the quote is the primary advantage: you can receive an immediate tax deduction, while still being able to give at a later time. By having a personal foundation or Donor Advised Fund, you can make donations when it makes sense for your personal finances and delay charitable gifts until a more convenient time. For example, if you fund the foundation on Dec. 31, you can take the money out of your taxable income for the previous tax year, and then have the flexibility to give whenever you choose. Many wealthy individuals prefer the Donor Advised Fund because it is easy to set up and has only one recipient for tax purposes. This simplifies the donation process and makes tax season less complicated."}
{"3043": "\n\nYou mentioned having multiple credit cards with varying balances, some with no balance, and others with high balances. I would recommend not closing the credit cards with zero balance if they have a lower APR. Instead, you can transfer balances to those cards with a lower APR. However, if those 0 balance cards do not have a lower APR, closing them could reduce your overall credit line, potentially damaging your credit rating. Nevertheless, this effect is only temporary if you continue to make timely payments. Remember, paying off your balance reduces your utilization rate, which increases your credit rating. It's important to pay off low balance accounts first before opening new credit accounts. This is because a larger number of accounts with amounts owed could indicate a higher risk of over-extension, leading to financial trouble."}

{"3045": "\n\nBonds are valued based on the time value of money, a fundamental concept in finance. Essentially, $100 one year from now is not equivalent to $100 today, as $100 today can be used to generate more money, whereas $100 in a year will be worth less due to inflation. Therefore, the future value of an investment made today at a given rate is calculated using FV = PV(1+r)t. \n\nZero-coupon bonds are sold for less than their face value, with the difference being the cost to borrow cash or interest. These bonds pay only face value at maturity, making them a simple bond option but costly due to tying up money until maturity. Coupon bonds, on the other hand, have a coupon rate (percentage of the face value of the bond) that is paid periodically, usually annually. The calculation for coupon bonds is straightforward, making them a more common bond option. \n\nThe income yield % is a simple measure of yield, calculated as R/P * V. However, it is crude and inaccurate as it does not consider the payment of coupons over time or maturity. The simple APY is the yield realized from all cash flows of the bond as if all matures at maturity, making it useful for comparing bond yield to other compound-interest-bearing accounts or for comparing zero-coupon bonds to coupon bonds. \n\nThe Yield to Maturity is the true yield percentage of the bond, accounting for all coupon payments made on time and reinvested at a similar yield over time. It is calculated using the simple APY while considering when coupon payments will be made and their present value. It can be calculated through the goal seek method in a computer. \n\nIn summary, bonds are valued based on the time value of money, with coupon bonds being a more common option due to their straightforward calculation. Yield measures such as income yield % and simple APY are useful for comparison purposes, but Yield to Maturity is the true measure of yield for a bond over its life."}

First Solar is a premier player in the photovoltaic industry, but investing in a fund can provide a false sense of diversification. For example, buying a mutual fund in the computer space in 2000 would have given you multiple pieces of technology companies like HP, Dell, Apple, IBM, EMC, Cisco, Intel, and many more, but their collective performance wasn't the same as the sector's. In my opinion, investing in \"pure play\" renewable energy stocks may not be the best strategy anymore. Instead, consider undervalued companies that have exposure to renewables but haven't been hyped up or included in sector mutual funds. However, the industry is reliant on government subsidies, and the current state of government budgets makes it a risky play. Proceed with caution."}

Firstly, leases involve the concept of returning the car at the end of the lease term which coincides with the highest depreciation rate in the first year or two. Continuously leasing cars on a short-term basis means you will own the vehicles during their most expensive years. While it is possible to buy through cash or loan and do the same, leasing sets a schedule that encourages adherence. Secondly, it is generally easier for dealers to conceal aspects of the contract from consumers when leasing. Salespeople often direct car purchasers to focus on the monthly payment or \"four-box\" the purchaser. However, the numbers involved in leases can be renamed and made unclear. For instance, \"capitalized cost\" represents \"price,\" \"money factor\" is the new term for \"interest rate,\" and \"capitalized cost reduction\" substitutes \"down payment.\" A new concept known as the \"residual value\" also enters the picture. These factors hold true regardless of whether or not the interest rates are lower."}

Market factors, such as sector performance and interest rates, also influence pricing. It can be difficult to assess how markets incorporate information about events; for example, higher interest rates may lead lenders to tighten credit or investors to sell bonds to lock in profits. These economic changes may also impact business profitability and stock market behavior.

{"3058": "\n\nThe impact of your mortgage and car loan on your credit has been significant in several areas. The mortgage has had the following impacts, while the car loan, which was taken out shortly after the house purchase, has had the following effects. Although you haven't provided details of your payment history, as you had a credit score of 800 prior to purchasing the house, it's safe to assume that your payment history is current and you haven't missed any payments. There is no mention of your credit utilization, but keeping it low is advisable, with experts suggesting 10%, 20%, and 30% as suitable thresholds. As the down payment on your house likely depleted your available funds and replacing the car may have caused additional financial strain, there may have been other expenses associated with the house purchase that could have increased your utilization percentage.\n\nIt's a good idea to lower your utilization ratio on your revolving accounts and pay off your car balance since you have multiple credit lines. Your Chase card has a good age, which is beneficial in terms of the age of credit, and although some experts suggest having only 2-4 credit cards, having accounts with age on them is usually a good strategy. The number of accounts you have shouldn't be an issue unless you have a high utilization rate or you miss payments. You haven't mentioned if your Chase card has any fees or expenses, so it would be advisable to check and then negotiate with Chase to reduce or waive any fees or cancel the card if necessary.\n\nLastly, it's wise to check your credit report for any errors which may impact your overall score.

{"3066": "\n\nInterestingly, in the United States, there are significant cost and tax savings associated with a static buy-and-hold portfolio versus investing in a fund. Several brokerages, such as FolioFN, have emerged to make managing multiple small holdings via fractional shares and commission-free trades more accessible to small investors. A static portfolio can be purchased for only a few dollars per trade, while investing in a fund entails various annual and one-time fees that can add up to as much as 1-2% of the investment. These fees can be substantial, particularly if they recur annually.\n\nMutual funds in the US must provide each investor with a 1099 tax form that details the investor's share of dividends and capital gains for the year. This can be problematic if you buy into a fund late in the year that has experienced capital gains, as you may end up with a tax bill for gains you did not make. Investors in funds may not realize that they are taxed on both their own holding period of the fund's shares and the fund's capital gains distributions incurred while the fund held its investments. Morningstar tracks this as Potential Capital Gains Exposure so investors can check before investing. Funds that have unsold losers in their portfolio are also affected by these same rules, resulting in what some call \"free riders\" \u2013 funds that can sell losers simultaneously with winners to remain tax neutral.\n\nIn contrast, buying and holding a portfolio incurs no capital gains taxes until the stocks in the portfolio are sold at a profit. Funds are often actively managed, meaning that experts alter the portfolio from time to time or advise the fund on specific investments. However, it's important to note that even these experts are required to inform investors that past performance is not indicative of future results."}

The \"Adj Close\" is adjusted for splits by dividing the \"Close\" price by the cumulative product of all splits that occurred after that day. However, the \"Adj Close\" does not adjust for dividends, as we can see from the fact that despite Siemens distributing dividends on Jan 30 and Feb 02, the \"Adj Close\" values do not change compared to the \"Close\" prices.

To further clarify, let's use a few diagrams. \n\nFirstly, let's say you invest an initial \u00a310k, which goes into the envelope and counts towards your \u00a315k limit: \n\n                 +---------ISA-------+ ----- \u00a310k --------->              \n                                  |                +-------------------+ \n   \nSo at this point, you have: \n\n                 +---------ISA-------+               \n                                  |    \u00a310k of cash     |\n                                  +-------------------+\n\nNext, you choose to buy a fund with the \u00a310k inside the envelope: \n\n                 +---------ISA-------+               \n                                  |    \u00a310k of ABC    |\n                                  +-------------------+\n\nThe fund appreciates to \u00a312k, which happens inside the envelope, but doesn't concern HMRC: \n\n                 +---------ISA-------+               \n                                  |    \u00a312k of ABC    |\n                                  +-------------------+\n\nYou then decide to sell the fund, again inside the envelope: \n\n                 +---------ISA-------+                \n                                  |    \u00a312k of cash   |                \n                                  +-------------------+\n\nFinally, you buy another fund inside the envelope: \n\n                 +---------ISA-----------------+               \n                                  | \u00a310k of JKL & \u00a32k of cash   |                \n                                  +-----------------------------+\n\nThis fund also appreciates to \u00a311k, with no impact on HMRC: \n\n                 +---------ISA-----------------+               \n                                  | \u00a311k of JKL & \u00a32k of cash   |               \n                                  +-----------------------------+\n\nOnce again, you sell the fund within the envelope: \n\n                 +---------ISA-------+               \n                                  |    \u00a313k of cash   |\n                                  +-------------------+\n\nFinally, you withdraw the funds from the envelope, without any capital gains liability: \n\n                 +---------ISA-------+ <---- \u00a313k ---------               \n                                  |                +-------------------+\n\nNote that after this withdrawal, the most you can insert into the ISA for the remainder of the tax year is \u00a35k, even if the envelope is empty, as the limit is based on total inserted funds for that year."}

The first, \"shallow risk,\" refers to a temporary drop in an asset's market price, also known as a \"quotational loss\" by Benjamin Graham. The second, \"deep risk,\" is the total loss of capital, meaning that even after adjusting for inflation, the investor may not recuperate their investment for decades, if at all. In other words, a quotational loss is a loss that cannot be explained by a change in the actual value of a company."}

While it's great that you haven't needed a credit card recently, there may come a time when you need to spend more than you have readily available. Fortunately, if you pay off your credit card promptly, the cost will be modest (or none if paid within 30 days). I learned this firsthand when I was traveling and faced unexpected expenses due to bad weather. I almost had to sleep at the train station because I had almost no money in my bank account and only a small student credit card. Think about scenarios like attending a funeral or dealing with a medical emergency, which could quickly become expensive. Even if you have savings, it may be more costly to break a CD or take short-term capital gains than paying one or two months of interest on a credit card."}

{"3089": "\n\nAs a Venezuelan who used to buy USD, I believe that the best explanation for the current situation can only be provided by someone who is living and working in Venezuela. When Hugo Chavez took the presidency in 1998, the Venezuelan economy was in good shape. However, fast forward to about 10 years later, and poor management, corruption, and communism had wreaked havoc in our economy. Most of the money coming into Venezuela, especially from oil, was not invested in the country but instead given away to other countries such as Cuba. Back then, Venezuela had an oil barrel going over $100, and a lot of money was coming into the country. Unfortunately, very little of this money was invested in Venezuela. As a result, most of the richest people who have bank accounts in Switzerland are Venezuelans who stole huge amounts of oil money.\n\nThis is what led to Venezuela having the worst economy in the entire American continent. There is not enough money inside the country to satisfy the inner market, and people have to pay overpriced amounts for anything bought abroad. In addition, only a very small number of people can actually purchase USD in Venezuela. For instance, in 2013, I was able to buy about $80/month with my monthly income, but currently, it is almost impossible for about 99% of Venezuelans. To illustrate, the minimum wage in Venezuela is 10,000 bolivares per month, while the black market exchange rate (as of January 2016) is 900bs per 1usd. Therefore, 10,000/900 results in 11.11 USD. Unfortunately, this is what about 50% of Venezuelans earn every month.\n\nConsequently, people buy USD even at an unfavorable rate for various reasons. Firstly, inflation in Venezuela is incredibly high, with the inflation from 2014-2015 being 241%. Therefore, having Bolivares in your bank account makes no sense as you will not be able to buy things or services you need at half of the cost. Secondly, a significant number of Venezuelans dream of living abroad because life in the country is not the best.\n\nRegarding the last question, why would Venezuela want to block the sale of dollars? Centralized currency management is an economic measure that should only last for six months tops. However, with the current state of the economy, it may take a few years to reverse this trend. Turukawa's Wikipedia link explains this in detail.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope this helps you understand why people in third-world countries and those with many economic challenges buy USD even at an unfavorable rate."}

{"3093": "\n\nRegarding your initial inquiry, there is evidence available on the subject. I recommend reading a paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis which contains valuable references to other publications that could help answer your questions about technical analysis. After reading the entire article, you can delve into some of the additional publications cited and come to your own conclusions. The following are relevant excerpts from the paper:\n\nThe article explores the concept of technical analysis in the foreign exchange market, with an emphasis on its relevance concerning the matter of market efficiency. \"Technicians\" perceive technical analysis as the recognition of price patterns, and the leveraging of regularities in traders' psychology. Literature on technical analysis demonstrates that simple technical trading rules on dollar exchange rates resulted in substantial, risk-adjusted earnings that lasted for fifteen years during the 1970s and 80s before they ceased.  Currently, more intricate and lesser-known regulations produce smaller earnings for comparable durations. Standard assertions that depend on risk adjustment and/or central bank intervention are not valid justifications for the observed excess returns generated by adhering to these simplified technical trading rules. Nonetheless, psychological biases could be contributing factors. We interpret the observed surplus of these incomes to technical trading rules as being compatible with the adaptive markets theory. \n\nMany find it perplexing that technical analysis is widely utilized in the foreign exchange market and others. This implies that traders are either making irrational choices on insignificant information or that past prices have practical insights for trading, which contradicts the healthy markets hypothesis asserting that no trading strategy should generate unusual profits on publicly accessible information such as prior rates, without assuming noteworthy risk. As such, much time and effort have been devoted to determining whether technical analysis is actually profitable or not. While one of the first studies by Fama and Blume (1966) found no evidence that a specific category of TTRs can generate abnormal earnings in the stock market, more special examination by Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron (1992) and Sullivan, Timmermann, and White (1999) has demonstrated contradictory evidence. Numerous examinations of the foreign exchange market have likewise provided evidence that TTRs can create systematic profits (e.g. Poole (1967), Dooley and Shafer (1984), Sweeney (1986), Levich and Thomas (1993), Neely, Weller, and Dittmar (1997), Gencay (1999), Lee, Gleason, and Mathur (2001), and Martin (2001))."}

As for private loans, it depends on the person and their relationship with the lender. It may not be wise to ask for money from a friend or relative if the purpose is to pay rent, as they may not consider you the best candidate for lending. However, they may lend you the money without asking for the purpose."}
{"3095": "\n\nThere are two possible scenarios to determine the relevant date and several options to establish the relevant price for your stocks. If the stocks were purchased in your name from the start, the relevant date is the purchase date. However, if you inherited the stocks, the relevant date is the date of the original owner's death. Checking with the company for original purchase records is recommended. In some cases, if the stocks were purchased in \"street name,\" the company may not have any such records, and you will have to identify the broker who holds them. Once you have identified the relevant date, get in touch with the company's \"investor relationships\" contact to ascertain the adjusted stock price on that date, adjusted for any splits, mergers, acquisitions, etc. This adjusted cost basis per share will serve as your reference. Alternatively, you could research historical prices using financial information sites such as Google, Yahoo, Bloomberg, or the relevant stock exchange. If you can't establish the cost basis or if doing so proves expensive, simply write the cost basis as $0 and claim the entire proceeds as gains. However, please note that this will entail paying capital gains tax on the full amount. It might be cheaper than conducting a full investigation to determine the actual numbers."}

{"3097": "\n\nAfter dealing with Social Security, state agencies, and banks numerous times myself, I want to offer some advice. Firstly, ensure that you know whether you are listed as a \"joint\" or \"authorized user/signer\" for an account. You can make a quick call to the bank to clarify this. Being listed as an authorized user only grants you the ability to use a credit or debit card to make purchases, but it doesn't mean that the money in the account is yours. However, if you are listed as a joint holder, it could lead to ownership issues that you need to address. By taking the time to clarify this, you can avoid unnecessary complications and save yourself time and effort.\n\nSecondly, it's important to be truthful with the agency you are dealing with, but it's equally important to understand the facts before you disclose them. If you are uncertain about what to report on a form, don't hesitate to seek clarification. For instance, you could ask whether being listed as an authorized user on someone else's account counts as having a bank account. Alternatively, if you are a joint account holder, you would need to know how that affects your eligibility. \n\nRemember that it's easier to get a clear answer from a bank than a government agency. If you provide accurate information to the agency, they can give you the correct advice and support. But if you don't give them accurate information, you might not get the help you need. Thus, always ensure that you have the facts with you when you contact an agency. In summary, taking these two steps can make navigating these bureaucratic systems a lot smoother."}

The specific tax treatment, whether it is considered as capital or ordinary gain, will depend on factors such as the type of stock, how it was acquired, and how long it was held. If the stock was bought as an investment and held for over a year, it will most likely receive capital gain treatment. However, this tax treatment only applies to the US.

{"3099": "\n\nSeveral mutual fund companies, including Vanguard (as of my last check many years ago), require smaller minimum investments, often around $1000, for IRA and 401k accounts. Some also offer smaller investment options for IRA accounts as long as you establish an automatic contribution plan that deposits a fixed amount each month or quarter. However, many companies charge an annual account maintenance fee per fund for IRA investments. This fee can range from $10 to $25, or more and applies unless the balance in the fund exceeds a certain threshold, typically $5K or $10K. It's best to pay this fee in cash rather than deducting it from your IRA investment.\n\nFor those starting out with an IRA, diversification into multiple funds is not the best strategy. Rather, it's better to invest in an S&P 500 Index fund like VFINX, or a Total Market Index fund or Target Retirement Fund, and then branch out into other types of mutual funds as your investment grows through future contributions and dividends.\n\nTo clarify the question about fund minimums, the IRA account is separate from a taxable investment account, and the minimum investment requirement applies to each account separately. However, as mentioned earlier, there may be smaller minimums for tax-deferred accounts."}

{"3106": "\n\nI believe this is a thought-provoking question with no definitive answer. A conservative investor may want to consider a mix of riskier and safer investments in response to low rates, while keeping a portion of their portfolio in cash. In a weak economy, great results should not be anticipated. For a deeper analysis, let's examine the three primary asset classes: cash, bonds, and stocks, and how they may perform in a low-interest-rate environment. When referring to stocks, it's worth noting that mutual funds invested in diversified stock portfolios, rather than individual stocks (which carry more risk), are being discussed. While diversification isn't crucial for government bonds, it is possible to use mutual funds for bonds.\n\nCash. Upsides include short-term safety and availability for emergencies. Downsides include low returns and potential inflation (although investing elsewhere is possible if inflation spikes).\n\nBonds. While offering somewhat higher returns than cash, they're also more vulnerable to inflation. Additionally, rising rates can cause a temporary dip in market price.\n\nStocks. In the long-term (20 years or more), stocks are better at preventing the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation. As a result, average returns are expected to be higher than those for cash or bonds. Short-to-mid-term price fluctuations and lower expected returns in dismal economic times are the drawbacks.\n\nWhile low-interest rates may modify the equation, investors must be familiar with these basic asset classes. A combination of the three may be able to provide the best risk-adjusted rewards."}

For example, a friend of mine opted for a pragmatic marriage based on tax laws and benefited financially, at the expense of family pressure and criticism. Unfortunately, this created tension later on when others used this as evidence that the couple did not love each other. In America, and other Western societies, there is often a stigma attached to pragmatic marriages.

Housing market prices are unlikely to experience significant spikes in the near future. As you continue to live rent-free for another year, you can save another $30,000 and eventually make a more informed decision about buying a home. Keep in mind that many couples who have dependents and extra expenses are able to manage their finances with a mortgage, car payments, and a $75,000 household income."}

This safe harbor rule is explained in the IRS publication 17 under the General Rule section. In most cases, you will need to pay estimated taxes for 2016 if the following apply to you: you anticipate owing a minimum of $1000 in taxes for 2016 after deducting your withholding and refundable credits, and your withholding and refundable credits are expected to be less than either 90% of the tax shown on your 2016 tax return or 100% of the tax displayed on your 2015 tax return (exceptions apply for fishermen, farmers, and taxpayers with higher incomes).

{"3122": "\n\nThe CPA's reference to $2,500 likely pertains to the de minimis safe harbor threshold increase in the final tangible property regulations, which was raised from the previous limit of $500 for taxpayers without an applicable financial statement. By electing the de minimis safe harbor election on your tax return, the IRS will not challenge your choice to either expense or capitalize amounts of $2,500 or less. Additionally, it's crucial to be consistent with your bookkeeping practices when making these choices in your tax return. For instance, if you capitalize laptops for bookkeeping purposes, you should also do so for tax purposes. While Section 179 offers an option to expense assets that would otherwise need to be capitalized and depreciated, it can be burdensome, especially if your LLC is considered a passthrough, and there may be recapture provisions if you dispose of the asset too soon. It's easier for tax preparers when there are no fixed assets to keep track of, which can be the case when you choose to expense all items and invoices less than $2,500."}
{"3123": "Are these the only taxes, or are there additional taxes on stocks? The turnover tax does not apply to retail investors, and other taxes are paid by the broker as part of the transaction, so there is no need to worry too much about them. Is there income tax on shares bought or held? No, income tax is not paid on buying or holding shares. However, if you buy and sell shares, you will have a capital gain or loss. If you hold a security for less than one year and sell it, it is classified as a short-term capital gain and is taxed at a special rate of 15%. Any short-term loss can be adjusted against other gains. If you hold a security for more than one year, it is classified as a long-term capital gain, but you cannot adjust long-term losses in stock markets. Will the money received from selling shares be taxable income for FY income tax? Only the gain (or loss) will be treated as income, not the complete sale value. To calculate the gain, you need to arrive at a purchase price, which includes the price of the stock, brokerage fees, STT, and all other taxes. Similarly, the sale price will be the sale price of the stock minus brokerage fees, STT, and all other taxes. The difference between the two is the gain. Will dividend/bonus/buy-back money be taxable? Dividends are tax-free for individuals because the company has already paid the dividend distribution tax. Bonuses are tax-free because they do not create any additional value. If you participate in a buy-back, it is treated as a sale of shares. Will the shareholder pay dividend distribution tax? No, the company pays it. What are capital gains? Capital gains are the profit or loss you make when buying and selling a particular security."}

{"3126": "\n\nIt appears that your definition of fundamental investing may not be accurate, which could explain why you deem it insignificant. In reality, fundamental investing involves valuing a stock by forecasting its future profitability, cash flows, and dividends. While one approach is to consider multiples, it's important to note that these are retrospective and may not accurately represent a company's potential for growth. For instance, when a firm's ratios deviate significantly from comparable companies, it could signify that the market expects substantial growth. However, this isn't conclusive evidence that the expectations are correct, and additional information is necessary to validate such assumptions. Warren Buffet, an esteemed fundamental investor, often assumes that overvaluation occurs when a firm's ratios appear to be unreasonable. Although this may be the case in some instances, it doesn't imply that the investors aren't employing fundamental analysis. Overall, fundamental investing remains a crucial factor in determining stock prices, as it involves considering aspects such as future growth and innovation, which transcends the evaluation of ratios."}

{"3138": "\n\nInterest rates are one factor that can impact house prices, but other factors, such as unemployment rates, also come into play. Generally, when interest rates decrease, borrowing money becomes cheaper, stimulating the economy and housing market by increasing demand for houses. This can cause house prices to rise, especially if the supply of new housing doesn't keep up with demand. Conversely, when interest rates increase, the opposite often occurs. Interest rates typically decrease to stimulate a slowing economy and increase to slow down an overheated one.\n\nIn your situation, you can take advantage of today's interest rates to secure a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, which means you won't have to worry about paying a higher rate if interest rates go up in the future. Since you plan to live in the house you're buying, a potential drop in the house's value shouldn't be a significant concern, as the value of other houses would likely drop as well.\n\nYour primary concern should be the risk of interest rates going up, potentially causing house prices to fall and unemployment to rise, which could affect your ability to make repayments. However, you believe interest rates won't go up in the US for a few years, and even then, the increase will likely occur slowly.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take steps to reduce your risk. For instance, you could save as much as possible, make extra repayments on your home loan, or develop new skills to remain employable. Doing your research on the types of houses you're interested in can also help you make better-informed decisions and avoid overpriced properties.\n\nUltimately, understanding the risks you face and developing strategies to manage them can help you feel more confident about moving forward with your purchase."}

However, in most US states, banks will transfer the money from an uncashed cashier's check to the state government after a statutory length of time. The state holds the funds as \"unclaimed property\" under the recipient's name (payee), and this process is known as escheatment.\n\nThe state usually publishes a list of unclaimed properties, and the payee may find their name on this list at a later date and claim their funds from the state. However, the state typically keeps any earned interest on the money. It is unlikely that you, the originator of the payment, can claim the funds after escheatment. If you possess the uncashed check before the escheatment process, you can generally return it to the bank for a refund.\n\nI encountered difficulty in finding an authoritative source on this matter, but a number of informal sources (easily found by searching \"cashier check escheatment\") seem to confirm the general process. A law firm's website claims that in California, an uncashed cashier's check escheats to the state after three years, and the payee can cash the check at any time until the escheatment occurs.

Even with low rates now, you will end up paying more in the long run. Instead, opt for a fixed-rate loan with rates that remain stable throughout the loan duration. \n\nChoose a fixed rate loan that matches your financial goals, whether it's a 30-year or a shorter-term period. The shorter the period, the lower your rates. However, current rates are so low that even 30-year fixed loans offer affordable APRs. \n\nConsidering your current equity, you will need to pay PMI. Note that this amount varies from lender to lender, so make sure to compare and shop around for the best PMI options. \n\nGovernment assistance programs may help you refinance your mortgage, even if it is underwater. Check for programs available in your area, as they differ from place to place. \n\nFinally, remember that closing fees and points will inevitably come out of your pocket, and these vary significantly between different lenders. Consider Credit Unions as these organizations tend to offer cheaper fees than big banks."}

If you choose to actively invest, I suggest using the Core & Satellite approach.

However, because stocks can decrease substantially in value when the market is closed, intraday traders are not allowed to keep a highly leveraged position overnight.

{"3167": "\n\nIn the market, there are both good brokers and spammers. Personally, I have been with FXCM since 2001 and have never encountered any problems. However, I recommend that you make your own choice. The question is, how can you differentiate a good broker from a bad one and ensure that they offer timely and reliable services? Online Google checks are not entirely reliable; there is so much trash talk about brokerage firms on blogs and websites due to intense competition. It is hence important to consult the regulator's website to be sure. For the US, NFA regulates all forex firms, and for the UK, it is FSA. You can find information on all regulated UK-based firms here, http://www.fsa.gov.uk/register/firmSearchForm.do. Remember that in many countries, regulation for forex companies may not be mandatory, but being regulated allows the government to monitor the firm's operations closely. Most forex firms provide accounts for traders ranging from large corporations to small traders, so there isn't much to consider even if you are a small trader. If you are a US citizen, you are limited by the US government to only trade with a broker within the US; it is forbidden to trade with any brokerage firm based outside the country. Forex trading entails a high level of risk, so it is necessary to research the markets thoroughly and gain proper education before investing your money. Although I have made significant profits trading forex, I have also observed many people losing everything. Therefore, please understand the risks and only invest money that you can afford to lose."}

Some people with financial stability may choose not to fulfill their obligations. Credit scores provide a comparative measure of an individual's payment history and ability to meet financial obligations.

If you are working as partners, it is advisable to have a written partnership agreement prepared by a lawyer who specializes in entity formation within the software industry. Even without a written agreement, you may still be legally considered a partnership if you are operating a business together. In this case, the partnership will have its own tax return, and the profits/losses will be allocated between the partners as agreed upon (often 50/50). These profits will be reported as self-employment income on your individual tax return. It is important to note that partnering will result in the loss of expense deductions, such as those claimed on a Schedule C, and home office deductions. Therefore, it is wise to include a clause in the partnership agreement stating that the partnership will reimburse partners for their out-of-pocket expenses. \n\nIn the event that Bob is hiring you as a contractor, you will provide your SSN and be issued a 1099, as with any other client. You will invoice him separately. The same applies to Joe; it is important to determine if you will be working with him as an independent contractor or as a partner. Regardless, you will owe income and self-employment tax on your profits. For partnership income, this amount will be reported on the K-1 from the partnership return. For independent contractors working as a sole proprietor, the income invoiced and received will be reported, as well as any associated expenses, including independent contractors that you hired, on Schedule C. \n\nIt is advisable to consult with a tax professional, preferably someone within your city and industry who is recommended by others, to discuss quarterly estimated payments and other tax-related matters.

There are many affordable places outside of the city where you can find better deals on houses or flats. Personally, I feel that London mortgages are too expensive and would like to question the logic behind only considering London as a place to live. The areas around London offer great places to live, excellent schools, and friendly neighborhoods that are removed from the noise of the city. Many people I work with commute from cities like Cambridge and Oxford into Central London every day and find it amusing that people only consider buying houses in London for the sake of it. The housing market seems to be inflated due to the finance market, and the London house market is different from the rest of the UK. Foreign investors tend to concentrate on the London property market, which inflates prices even more. Even high property taxes have not discouraged investment in the city.

{"3172": "\n\nThe Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the discount rate, r*, that equates to a Net Present Value (NPV) of zero. In essence, this means that the IRR and NPV methods are two different approaches to evaluate profitability. You can either choose a project with NPV(10%)>0 or select a project with an IRR value greater than 10%. Ideally, both methods should lead to the same project selection. However, this is possible only when the mathematical calculations of the expected cash flows are accurate. Sometimes, the process of identifying the IRR involves solving for the roots of a polynomial equation that yields multiple possible solutions. In such cases, people usually select the lowest positive root. This method proves effective only when the project yields positive NPV values for r values less than r* and negative NPV values for r values greater than r*.\n\nTo clarify, suppose you want to evaluate a real estate project for a 10% return. You can either calculate the sum of discounted future cash flows (NPV) with r=10% and select the project if NPV is positive, or calculate the NPV as a function of the discount rate (r) and look for the value of r* where NPV=0. If IRR=r*>10% and the NPV function adheres to the previously described guidelines, you can proceed with the project selection.\n\nIn summary, when the possibility of multiple roots is not a concern, either of these methods will result in the same project selection that matches the 10% return requirement."}

While it is true that there may be more people attempting to short a stock during regular trading hours than in the pre-market, it is also true that many people are covering their shorts during regular trading hours. For stocks that are difficult to short, every instance of someone covering a short creates an opportunity for others to enter a short position. In the event that your broker rejects your short order due to a lack of available shares, I suggest continuing to place the order throughout the day as there may be a chance that you submit it right after someone else covered their short and before the next person can enter a short position.

The success of this venture will depend on the location, size of the shop, and whether there is a market for coffee enthusiasts in the area. As the rent/mortgage is already covered, the only expenses required are for the interior design (which could feature trendy rustic exposed brick walls, nostalgic filament lights, and a chalkboard menu), seating (including a big communal table, lounge couch, regular table chairs, and outdoor seats), and licensing and approval. Social media marketing, SEO, and review sites like Yelp, Urbanspoon, and TripAdvisor could also be utilized. A historic building could add to the unique and competitive edge of this coffee shop and attract more customers than a typical chain like Starbucks. Even if the shop fails, the recurring additional expense would only be the barista wages. Saving costs could be achieved by shopping for furnishings and equipment on community sites like Craigslist and Gumtree. In the future, premade food items like banana cake, raw cacao balls, and toasted panini sandwiches could be added. The three key ingredients to succeeding in the food industry are location, vibe, and taste. However, 95% of businesses fail in the first three years, so it is important to have an exit plan. The bookshop currently has a collection of old, self-published books that are not selling. To help boost sales, these books could be converted into e-books using providers like Blueleaf Book Scanning and published on Amazon Kindle, iTunes, and Play Store.

{"3188": "\n\nThe purpose of this payment method is not to require individuals to pay off their entire debt at once, as it would be more sensible to have them pay off the debt rather than just the interest. Rather, the goal is to maintain a consistent payment amount each month, which is easier for most people to budget for. This is known as an annuity in the field of finance. While other methods, such as paying off a set amount of debt each month, could theoretically be used, they would result in varying monthly payments. An annuity ensures a constant cash flow. In finance, there are generally three methods of debt repayment: annuity, serial loan, and standing loan. An annuity involves fixed payments with higher interest payments initially and decreasing debt payments later. Serial loan features equally spread out debt payments with interest paid on the remaining debt, resulting in a decreasing cash flow over time. A standing loan only requires interest payments during the repayment period, with all debt paid back at the end of the loan. In Europe, a common practice is to combine a 30-year annuity with a 10-year standing loan, where interest is paid for the first 10 years, followed by a fixed monthly payment for the remainder of the loan. This approach is particularly useful for first-time buyers who may have lower salaries initially and require more flexibility at the beginning of their adult lives."}

This way, Lachlan would have $2,100 ($600 cash + $1,500 for his old car). However, this is not enough to meet the 10% deposit requirement of $2,280, leaving Lachlan approximately $200 short.\n\nTo calculate the required amount for the price increase, we can start with Lachlan's initial funds plus the amount of increase being x. Hence, $1,100 + x is the deposit amount, and $21,800 + x is the new car's cost. Since the deposit should be 10% of the total cost, we can create an equation,  $1,100 + x = 10% of ($21,800 + x) = $2,180 + 0.1 x.\n\nSolving this equation, we get $1,200 as the needed price increase for both the old and new cars.

However, the primary borrower may object to both options, and a judge will determine the merit of your case. If the primary borrower picks up the payments, you can still pursue legal action for the money you have paid by providing documentation such as bank statements.

{"3211": "\n\nFrom the Indian context, several factors are influencing the economic condition and reflecting in the exchange rates and interest rates. Using India as an example, I will try to answer the question. For the last 6-7 years, India has been running a budget deficit of around 4%, meaning that the government is spending more than it is collecting in revenue. To cover this deficit, the government has to print money, which can either directly account for the 4% or cover the interest it has to pay on the money it borrows. This printing of money causes an increase in the supply of INR compared to USD in the market, resulting in the value of INR falling with respect to USD. Additionally, this leads to an increase in money supply in the domestic market, which in turn causes inflation and a rise in overall prices.\n\nTo curb this price rise, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increases the interest rates and the Compulsory Reserve Ratio (CRR) to control the money supply. However, there is a limit to what RBI can do as overall growth rates decrease because money becomes more expensive to borrow and invest. It is crucial to note that the economy has many factors involved, and the above explanation should be treated as simplistic insight only."}

Learning to communicate your financial plans, goals, and actions, while being honest and open with your partner, is crucial. Ensure that you both agree on the decisions you make. Start by drafting a budget that you both agree to follow. There are online budgeting tools available, and tracking planned versus actual expenses on a spreadsheet may help inform your choices. Adjust the following percentages based on your priorities: Essentials (<50% of net income), Financial (>20%), and Lifestyle (<30%) for discretionary expenses. Some expense categories require special attention. Housing costs should stay below 25% of your income, unless you live in a high-cost/rent area. Vehicle expenses should be limited to below 10% of income or budgeted partially from Lifestyle. Additionally, limiting your auto payment to 5% of your income may be wise. Examine expenses such as cable TV and cell phones with constrained budgets in mind. Dining out can also negatively impact your budget, and preparing more meals at home may be a more cost-effective solution. Lastly, based on your specific priorities, follow the necessary steps to stick to your budget."}

These APs possess sufficient resources to package shares they already own and hold, aligning them with the requirements of the ETF. For the EDEN ETF, this portfolio aligns with the MSCI Denmark Index. Only APs can engage directly with the ETF manager, bundling up portfolios of shares and delivering them in exchange for the corresponding number of shares in the ETF. Note that no cash exchanges hands in this transaction. Investors do not transact business directly with the ETF manager, but rather purchase and sell ETF shares in the market via the AP. \n\nWhen ETF shares require redemption, the AP will deliver these shares to the ETF manager, receiving the corresponding portfolio of shares in return, again avoiding any cash exchange. Established and liquid ETFs normally witness small purchases and sales of ETF shares between individual investors in the market. If an AP needs to transact business with an investor, either buying or selling ETF shares, they may do so. In the event that an AP has insufficient ETF shares to meet demand, they will bundle up a portfolio and deliver it to the ETF provider, receiving the required ETF shares in return. If a large number of investors sell off ETF shares, the AP may end up holding an excessive number of ETF shares, which they will deliver to the ETF manager in exchange for the corresponding portfolio of underlying shares. This approach prevents any significant impacts on share prices of underlying portfolios, as those shares are not sold in the market but returned to the AP in exchange for ETF shares. Again, note that no cash is exchanged in this transaction. Dividends and distributions to ETF holders follow the same scheme."}

Therefore, they will always have some deviation from exact numbers but should follow the general pattern.

To address this, placing them all on one graph shows that the funds broadly followed the VIX over five years, even when some began their investments during this period. The funds declined faster than the VIX starting from 2012, which can be attributed to lower returns on volatility. The recent narrowing gap in the graphs indicates an interest in betting on volatility following recent events. The consistent decline of the VIX over time can be attributed to improved economic conditions and a decrease in the risk of European countries defaulting.

{"3226": "\n\nThere are now restrictions on the amount a company can pay a child employee based on the nature of their work. Previously, there were no regulations on this matter, but now employers must pay a reasonable wage that corresponds to the duties performed. It is not permissible for a company to pay a child $100/hr while others performing the same job are receiving minimum wage. One might wonder why parents would opt to pay their child an exorbitant wage. The answer lies in the fact that the salary paid to a child is tax-deductible for the company while the child can use that money to cover their expenses like hockey fees, equipment, field trips, and birthday presents, as well as save for their post-secondary education. Thus, the family budget can expand, allowing parents to lower their own pay if they have financially demanding children. This results in more net income for the business and reduced total income tax for the family, even with the same total income. My concern is that if parents are unaware that minimum wage applies regardless of family relationship, then they may also not know how to handle other matters such as EI deductions and summer student subsidies.

{"3227": "\n\nWhen discussing real estate, you will often hear general rules of thumb. Similar to the adage that one should only buy stocks if they plan to hold them for more than X years, there are periods where buying at the bottom of the market just before it turns up can put you ahead only months after purchasing. Buying below market value can also put you ahead on the day you close the sale. \n\nI maintain, with support from Schiller's data, that real estate prices rise with inflation in the long term, and no more. If the rise were perfectly smooth and correlated 100% month to month, it would take X years to break even on the costs of buying, commission, and closing, which we can estimate at about 8%. If inflation averages 3%, then a holding period of around 3 years would be required to break even. However, as real estate prices rise and fall in the short term, there are periods where real estate lags, taking longer than 4 years to catch up, and periods where it rises faster, putting you ahead of the costs involved. \n\nBuying versus renting is an additional consideration. If you happen upon a tight rental market, you may buy a property, see it decline in value by 10%, and still end up ahead of someone who rented when the costs are calculated."}

However, within an established neighborhood, you can have a glimpse of how the community currently is and how it has evolved over time. You do not have control over the quality of construction unless you build or remodel yourself. Some homes constructed by Pulte in the last decade have been plagued with defects. \nFurthermore, when purchasing a newly constructed home, you pay for several features that you may not require. In some cases, these features may interfere with your future plans. In stable markets, new homes, especially those with many upgrades, tend to decline in value during the first few years as the value of these upgrades wears off.

This study investigates whether individual banks have the ability to create money out of nothing when granting loans. The traditional fractional reserve and financial intermediation theories suggest that banks transfer funds from other accounts to make loans available. However, after examining the process by which loaned money is deposited into a borrower's account, it was discovered that no transfer from internal or external accounts occurred. Therefore, both theories were rejected. Instead, it was found that the bank generated new funds by crediting the borrower's account with a deposit, without the need for an actual deposit. These findings support the credit creation theory, indicating that individual banks do indeed create credit and money from scratch when granting so-called \"bank loans.\" Loans are not made with existing funds, but rather new money is brought into existence, essentially created from nothing. This unique power is, to our knowledge, the first time in banking's five-thousand-year history that empirical evidence has demonstrated how individual banks create credit and money.

The answers to these questions cannot be found here. Regarding taxes, both options have no difference in liability protection (seek verification from a lawyer), as personal cosigning is required in either case. If you loan to the LLC, all information will be included in the 1065 form, and your K-1 will be transferred to your own tax return. On the other hand, loan interest will be considered a personal investment expense (Schedule A deduction), and the loan proceeds transferred to the LLC will add to your basis. If possible, it is advised to get the loan under the LLC's name to limit personal liability. However, lawyers warn that this action may void the mortgage agreement due to the \"Due on Sale\" clause. Although invoking this clause is uncertain, it is still a possibility if the title is transferred. While living trusts differ from LLCs, lenders may still call on the loan if you retitle it as the LLC is considered a separate legal entity."}
{"3251": "\n\nAssuming you now make more than what you used to as a student, let's figure out how you can save that extra income. All calculations should be done after taxes. First, determine your cost of living, including housing, utilities, and basic necessities. Don't factor in food costs unless they were subsidized during school. Calculate how much you're spending on basic sustenance. Once you know that, compare it to how much more you're making now. Subtract the sustenance cost from your new income to get your net pay increase.\n\nAfter this, it gets more complicated. While you want to save as much of your pay increase as possible, you now have more expenses compared to your student life. These costs could be anything from transportation to clothing, so decide on a savings goal as a percentage of your net pay increase, such as 5%, 10%, or even 50%. Keep in mind that the amount you choose must be reasonable given your living expenses.\n\nFind a financial institution with a high-interest savings account, preferably with free withdrawals, and sign up. Every payday, transfer the percentage you chose into your savings account. If your pay amount doesn't change, you can automate this transfer. Try to live on the remaining amount, but don't hesitate to withdraw from your savings account if necessary. Adjust your deposits and expenses accordingly each month.\n\nAt the end of each month, deposit any amount left from your regular account into your savings account, and consider increasing your savings goal if you've saved a substantial amount. The ultimate goal is to have a decently sized nest egg that you only tap into in exceptional situations while still having enough money outside of your savings account to treat yourself occasionally.\n\nRemember that the goal is not to make money but to figure out how much you need to maintain your chosen lifestyle. Stick to your savings plan for several months to a year, and you'll eventually find an amount you feel comfortable setting aside each month. Whenever you receive a net pay raise, increase your savings goal by a portion of that raise (e.g., give yourself 60% of the increase and bank the remaining 40%).\n\nOne main benefit of this approach is that if you lose your job, you'll have a nest egg and a lower monthly expense, which puts you in a better position than having neither."}
{"3252": "\n\nFirstly, if an account is jointly held, the surviving account holder usually inherits the debt. In the case of joint accounts, assets typically have their own instructions for distribution. For example, full joint bank accounts immediately transfer to the other account holder and do not become part of the estate. Non-monetary assets may need to be converted to cash and undergo a fair market valuation for probate, unless they can be transferred to the next of kin without being sold. If the deceased has remaining assets, a legally defined order determines which debts are to be paid first (this varies by state) during probate. During this process, a death notice is published and outstanding bills and debts are paid in order of priority. If there are insufficient assets to pay all debts, court approval may be necessary. Any remaining assets are then dispersed to the next of kin. If there are no assets held singularly by the deceased, any bills received can be ignored by sending a certified copy of the death certificate indicating there is no estate to claim. While handling probate is neither simple nor cheap, a lawyer's assistance can be beneficial in determining which debts require payment and managing the probate process. It's important to note that creditors may consider accepting a lesser payment if there are assets available. In the case of the writer's mother's passing, the hospitals accepted reduced payment, but not the credit card companies who demanded full payment."}

However, after 3 years, you may be able to obtain small lines of credit to start rebuilding your credit. Learning from your mistakes is essential, and there is no shame in making them. To rebuild your credit, you can start with small credit lines, such as those from Fingerhut or a $300 limit unsecured credit card from Capital One. Additionally, a $1500 personal loan to purchase an older car instead of saddling yourself with car payments may be an option. You can also inquire about a secured credit card from your bank to begin building credit using your own money. \n\nIt is important to note that some banks view a bankruptcy as an advantage because they know you cannot file again for several years. You can also obtain a new car loan with a good interest rate by making a sizable down payment, such as $5000 of your $15,000 savings. However, it is wise not to exhaust all of your savings.

From an economic standpoint, there is no difference between this scenario and that of a foreign worker sending remittances back home.

Whether this is ultimately beneficial or detrimental is dependent on various factors, making it challenging to determine the answer in isolation.\n\nHowever, in general, foreign worker remittances are overwhelmingly advantageous for both the host country, which receives productive labor that may not otherwise be available, and the source country, which gains export income. When it comes to your specific inquiry about local inflation, an increase in exports results in a rise in the exchange rate, meaning that the domestic currency becomes pricier when compared to the Euro in this example. This appreciation in the exchange rate can actually help reduce inflationary pressures. On the other hand, the absence of a worker from the local economy can potentially drive up local wages and inflation.\n\nNonetheless, both of these effects are minimal, and other factors will likely have a more significant impact on the situation."}
{"3260": "\n\nRevised: It is important to note that past results do not guarantee future outcomes in the stock market. The market has no explicit upper limit, and even if individual company values remain flat, the market has historically tended to show an upward trend over the long-term.

Attempting to time the market is risky and is often comparable to gambling. The most straightforward approach to investing in the stock market involves a combination of buy-and-hold and dollar-cost averaging strategies. By purchasing stocks at a constant dollar amount per month, an investor can take advantage of buying opportunities presented by market downturns without sacrificing potential gains when the market trend is up. Personally, to maximize gains, I also practice contrarian buying by increasing my stock purchases when the market is depressed, provided I have funds I won't require anytime soon. This approach allows me to classify myself as an aggressive investor despite not engaging in micromanaging of my money, my goal remaining to have my money working for me instead of the other way around."}

This was not a wise decision as it could negatively impact their personal finances. If your parents can transfer the debt to the LLC before dissolving it, it would be the best possible outcome. However, because the business has been struggling for a long time, creditors may not be willing to provide a loan. Your parents may be able to convince a judge to transfer the debt to the LLC, but credit card companies will resist this as it gives them less hope of recovering their money. To increase their chances of success, your parents need to demonstrate that their credit cards were only used for business expenses. Filing for bankruptcy is an option, specifically a Chapter 13, which can potentially negotiate a payment plan for the debts.

This type of transaction is comparable to a customer purchasing a box of widgets for future delivery. It differs from the scenario in which a customer buys a gift card or reloadable debit card where sales tax is not collected because it's not technically a purchase, and revenue is only recognized when the card's balance is used to pay for goods or services.\n\nIn the former scenario, the customer has ownership of an asset, the credits, which cannot be taken away, whereas, in the latter, the holder of the debit card is an unsecured creditor of the company. In cases where the cost of credits increases or a discount promotion is applied, the credits retain their functionality, regardless of price changes. \n\nIf the business model is based on account deposits rather than credit purchases, revenue recognition occurs when the usage is billed at the current rate, and sales tax is collected on the purchase of services. However, the deposit would need to be refundable, not expire, and be usable on a variety of services.

{"3274": "\n\nThe way that limit orders are fulfilled depends on the specific exchange used for trading. While I cannot speak to how Scottrade operates, it is common for limit orders to be fulfilled in the order they were placed. Generally, stocks do not drop significantly below the bid price, but for highly volatile penny stocks, it is possible that the price could rapidly drop below your bid and then bounce back up, resulting in only a partial fulfillment of the order. For example, imagine a penny stock priced at $0.12, with other traders placing limit orders to buy at $0.10, and you also placing a limit order at $0.10. If the price drops to $0.07, orders placed at or above that price point will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis. If the demand for the stock increases, driving the price above $0.10 before your order is filled, it is possible that your bid will not be fulfilled at that time. Additionally, if the price drops from $0.12 to $0.07, older orders at or above $0.07 may be fulfilled before your order at $0.10. For example, an older order for 100 shares at $0.09 may be filled before a newer order for 800 shares at $0.07, with only a subset of those shares being filled before the price increases again."}

{"3279": "\n\nTo avoid spending time understanding your numbers, allow me to explain the basics of trading an upside-down car for a financed one. It's important to differentiate between price and value. When you acquire a car, you pay a price for it, and its value is what someone else will pay you for it in the future. Financing a car involves agreeing on a price of, say, $10,000, and paying back Mr. Bank with interest over time. After making 12 payments, you still owe around $8,195 to Mr. Bank.\n\nNow, let's say you want to trade your current car with a value of $7,000 for a new $20,000 car. The dealership agrees to give you $7,000 for your old car, which covers its value. But you still owe $8,195 to Mr. Bank, which the dealership pays to acquire the title. This leaves you with a new loan of $21,195 for the new car, which includes the $1,195 you still owed on the old car. It's important to note that what you previously paid, the initial down payment, and the old car's purchase price no longer matter. The only relevant factors are the amount owed on the old car and the value the buyer, in this case, the dealership, is willing to pay for it.\n\nDetermining the exact \"loss\" in this scenario is difficult because the car's utility has value, but it could be argued that the $1,195 added to your new loan to pay for the old car is lost."}

Visiting stocktwits.com may reveal a plethora of opposing opinions, which may be correct over different time-frames. Try to gauge your confidence level and prepare multiple strategies accordingly. Personally, I lacked the intelligence and discipline to be a successful value investor. The frustration of watching stocks remain stagnant for years before the company's intrinsic value was reflected in the market was unbearable. Moreover, despite making an outstanding selection, a macro shift or a slump could delay progress and raise concerns.\n\nIn my experience, portfolio management techniques like asset allocation and dollar-cost-averaging played a pivotal role in my version of value investing.

I see myself in you, and like me, you may develop false understanding through excessive reading of Securities Analysis 6th edition, leading to overconfidence. Remember that despite the market's scientific nature, various factors come into play turning it into an art form. While I am uncertain of your situation, applying the principles of value investing shared by Graham and Buffet requires investment that entails the use of the consolidation or equity method of accounting (> 20% ownership). While the same principles could work on a smaller scale, a small-scale investor should focus on wealth accumulation in multiple forms rather than instant equity through acquisitions.\n\nLastly, to test your prowess in value investing and order execution, try the inverse, at least on paper. Short a stock with a low value but a high P/E. TWTR may be an appropriate example. Discover the effects of resource deployment and experience the agony of security and market volatility.

{"3282": "\n\nAs someone who works in buy-side finance, I understand the frustration that can arise from small data issues. I'm offering insight below that may help explain price differences: \n\nReasons for price differences: \n\n1. Vendor and data source: Data providers, like Google and Yahoo, aggregate EOD data from their vendors. While the raw data comes from the same exchange, different vendors collect it through different trading platforms. For example, Yahoo sources its stock data from Hemscott, which may not be the most accurate source. Google, in contrast, gets its data from Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Additionally, vendors may gather EOD data from other providers or exchanges or even produce their own open, high, low, close, and volume data from trade tick-data \u2013 and these data may come from any exchange. \n\n2. Price adjustment: For equities data, re-distributors typically adjust raw data by applying customized procedures, such as accounting for corporate actions, like dividends and splits. Rolling is required for futures data, and backward and forward rolling can be chosen. Different adjustments can affect the price display. \n\n3. Extended trading hours: With electronic trading, markets tend to trade during extended hours, which introduces another element of freedom in price reporting. Re-distributors must decide whether to include price movements during extended trading hours. \n\nConclusion: To verify the true price, always check with the exchange where the asset is actually traded. Professional traders and investors typically use Bloomberg, Reuters, and other paid providers. However, for personal use, Yahoo and Google are both valid choices, and the differences in their data are usually small enough to ignore."}

{"3284": "\n\n@jlowin's answer provides an excellent discussion of the different types of PE ratios. I will focus on answering a specific question within your query: who makes the estimates for future earnings? Professional analysts and analytical teams in the market generate future earnings estimates based on various factors. Investment companies use these frequently updated estimates as the basis for their PE ratio. The company's own expectations are not used as they may be biased. Analysts use a range of data, including economic data, forecasting, surveys of sentiment, and current events, to build an ongoing model of the company's finances. The sophistication of the model depends on the size and resources of the analytics team. For larger and more liquid firms, or small and fast-growing firms, creating such a model can be a significant undertaking. Some analytics teams even send analysts out to gather data on the company and industry that they follow. This analysis is more valuable to trading teams and paying clients than for public relations purposes, so estimates are only released a few times a year. These projections are accurate at the time of release, but their value diminishes over time, particularly if the firm launches new initiatives. Hence, weighting analyst forecasts based on the time since release results in a better average. Most private investors use an average or time-weighted average of analyst estimates to calculate the forward PE ratio."}

This is particularly concerning when considering that, collectively, the three banks have issued 50 million mortgages. If as few as 20% of borrowers are unable to keep up with payments, the banks face a substantial risk. Refinancing enables banks to reduce the principal and interest owed by borrowers, which ensures that they continue to receive payments. In fact, during the 2007-2008 financial crisis, credit card companies lowered customers' spending limits to control their risk. Therefore, before deciding whether to refinance, research should be done to determine whether it is the best option."}

Though the end cost borne by the consumer is the same under both systems, with VAT, the tax is collected from the manufacturer rather than the consumer. There are several reasons to support VAT, including its ability to reduce loss of revenue due to smuggling, which may increase disproportionately with sales tax. VAT is also advantageous as it spares shippers and other layers of the production process which do not affect the fundamental value of the product from bearing the tax burden."}

However, this model is unsustainable, as it would require signing up every person on the planet to keep the money flowing in.

As a result, the company is in Administration and being managed by a regulated Australian authority. The administrator's job is to find suitable buyers so that most of the creditors can be paid off. However, in the case of TEN, the liabilities are so significant that no one is willing to buy the company. The deal with CBS would also mean that existing shareholders would not receive any payment as the value is negative. Since the company is a separate legal entity, it cannot recover the negative value from the shareholders. Even the current creditors may not be paid in full, and some may lose money."}
{"3297": "\n\nIt is highly probable that the fund distributed a dividend in the form of reinvested shares, a common practice among many funds especially towards the end of the year. Here's a simplified demonstration of how this works: Let's assume that you invested $1000 and acquired 100 units at $10 per unit. Without taking into consideration the daily price fluctuations, if the fund paid a dividend of 20%, you would receive $200 and the unit price would drop to $8 per unit. If you chose to reinvest the dividend, you would automatically purchase an additional $200 worth of units at the new price (thereby acquiring 25 more units). Consequently, you would then have 125 units worth $8 each, i.e. an investment of $1000. Note that in this example, although you now have more shares than your initial investment, the price has reduced significantly, and your market value is higher than your initial investment probably due to a slight price increase. \nTo confirm, you should see the dividend transaction listed on your account. I did a quick search on ICENX and confirmed that they indeed paid a dividend yesterday."}

Cash gifts are particularly considered as wages regardless of the manner in which they are received. Even when there's no contractual obligation or the amounts are too high to be regarded as personal gifts, the IRS still considers such payments as \"disguised wages.\" The IRS uses several tests to determine non-taxable benefits, which are outlined in IRS publication 535 and publication 15-B. It's unlikely that one could successfully argue that they were working full-time for a meager amount while simultaneously receiving huge personal gifts. Consequently, these payments would almost certainly be treated as taxable wages for services rendered."}

On the other hand, your student loan is a real financial obligation, and the longer you take to pay it off, the more interest you will accumulate. You could pay off your student loan in 21 months by making $1,100 monthly payments. After that, you could allocate your funds towards fully funding a 401(k) each year, which would be an impressive accomplishment at your age.

It is also important to consider other lenders and estimate the amount of paperwork involved for each option (new first, new 2nd, and new lender). Inquire about what options they can offer you, and evaluate their offer based on the costs of money and time for each option. Keep in mind that what they offer will depend on various factors including whether they value you as a customer or not, whether they expect you to walk away, whether they are looking to get rid of mortgages like yours, and whether they can make more money with the plan they are offering. When evaluating their offer, focus on the upfront costs, the monthly costs, and the timeline required to complete the process."}

For instance, if you are three years into a 30-year mortgage, compute the payment as if the loan is for 27 years. This calculation will give you a clearer picture of the actual savings. Then, divide the savings by your closing costs, if any, to determine the break-even point. If you plan to stay in the house for that long, it's the right choice. However, even if it helps you save just 1/8%, a no-closing-cost deal is worth considering."}

{"3311": "\n\nIt appears that the \"gross receipt tax\" is essentially the same as what most states refer to as the \"sales tax.\" This tax is typically applied after the price is displayed, resulting in the final price calculation. This method is commonly used since taxes typically involve fractions of pennies, making total calculation more accurate than calculating tax for each item separately. While it is theoretically possible to adjust prices to display even numbers when tax is added, it would require fractional cents to many decimal places. Additionally, in some locations, it is illegal to display only the with-tax price. Though some businesses may be willing to deal with the fractions, it is not worth the effort to fight against the common practice of sales tax. The closest thing to this is occasional offers of \"we'll pay your sales tax\" or statewide sales-tax free days once a year."}
{"3312": "\n\nConvertible notes are frequently used by angel investors who desire to fund businesses without establishing a company valuation. When an investor buys equity in a startup, the purchase price of equity implies a valuation of the company. For example, if an investor purchases 10% ownership of a company for $1 million, the company's value is assumed to be $10 million. To avoid affecting the terms of later-stage investments, some early-stage investors may prefer not to set a valuation in this way. Convertible notes are structured as loans when investors first invest. When a later equity investor appears, the outstanding loan balance will automatically convert into equity according to the terms set by the later-stage equity investor. Investors purchase equity in a company, and an angel investor who invests $100,000 in a convertible note may convert their investment to 1/10 of the equity investor's claim after receiving a 10% stake for a $1 million investment. In certain cases, the angel investor may also receive additional shares to compensate for their earlier investment risk. In a worst-case scenario if the company performs poorly, the converted shares could become worthless, leaving the note holder with no course of action. The seniority of debt determines how it will be serviced, with higher seniority debts being paid off first. The agreements made during the transaction will outline these details.

{"3314": "\n\nTo achieve this goal, the most effective approach is to create a contingency plan for your purchase of a new home based on the sale of your old one. Your initial offer should include this contingency, as well as a specific time frame for your house to sell in order to finalize the agreement. Additionally, there may be a clause in the contract giving the seller the option to cancel it if another offer is made within a certain period (usually 24-48 hours), which allows you to either sell your house or arrange financing in time. For instance, let's say you offer $300,000 on a new home with a contingency clause based on the sale of your old home, and the seller agrees. Suppose the seller then receives an offer of $275,000 cash (without a contingency clause). The seller must inform you of the new offer, permitting you time to meet your initial agreement by selling your house or financing $300,000. If you are unable to do so, the seller can accept the cash offer instead. While the above is just a hypothetical, the contingency clause feature will depend on both parties agreeing. Typically, sellers will want compensation for this benefit. That may come in the form of a higher offer or some other clause that benefits them. Alternatively, some buyers may choose to find a home first and then set a closing date further out to sell their house before that time. However, such sellers are rare. Most contingency clauses are included in the purchase agreement. Ultimately, the costs of contingency or financing should be compared to decide which is preferable. A competent real estate agent should be able to handle this situation effortlessly, irrespective of the factors involved."}

{"3319": "\n\nThis text explains how a loan is structured and how interest accrues each month. The reason for breaking out the interest amount is to show how much interest is accumulated during a specific month - this is typically the only place where this information is shown. The monthly payment (M) consists of the sum of interest accrued during that month and some principal, say M=I+P. The loan balance (B) is the total amount owed. Accrued interest (I) is fixed at the amount that accumulated during that month and must always be paid off. As the principal is reduced each month, I also decreases. If the daily interest rate is 3%, the interest owed each month is approximately (0.03*B*31) plus a bit of interest on the interest that accrues. P is most commonly calculated based on an amortization table, providing a fixed monthly payment, making it easier for people to manage their finances. Therefore, P changes each month rather than M. It is important to show the I amount so that borrowers can verify that they are paying the loan correctly and for tax purposes."}

I recommend two articles, [1] and [2], which provide valuable information on income types and deductions. \n\nAccording to the articles, many artists have a combination of income types- regular wages and self-employment income. Regular wages involve taxes and other withholdings, while self-employment income may be in cash, check, or goods without any withholding. The articles provide a detailed breakdown of expenses and deductions based on the type of income you receive. \n\nIf you receive a regular paycheck, your employer should provide you with a form W-2 at the end of the year. You can then claim relevant expenses on a Schedule A or Form 2106. If you're an independent contractor, you'll receive payments without any withholding, making you responsible for the Social Security and Medicare taxes, known as the Self-Employment Tax. To deduct your expenses, you'll need to complete a Schedule C with detailed expense categories.\n\nFurthermore, it's best to receive a 1099 MISC from your employer(s) as an independent contractor. It's important to note that some states collect a non-resident entertainers' tax - a state tax that requires a certain percentage of the gross earnings to be withheld for the state. \n\nI strongly recommend keeping all receipts, pay stubs, 1099 forms, W2's, and even contracts written on napkins, as these documents will be necessary for your tax returns. Lastly, consulting with a tax professional is crucial for a seamless process."}

Open-end funds must sell and purchase securities to maintain the index, which can increase transaction costs. It is interesting to see how well these costs can be managed.

Upon trying the app, you will be able to determine the optimal conditions for renting or buying a property. Personally, I concluded that purchasing a property outright by retirement age, if not sooner, was the best approach. \n\nFor example, consider the scenario of purchasing a \u00a3400,000 house or renting for \u00a31,000 per month, while saving an equivalent amount to achieve the same monthly expenses as the buyer. The variables of mortgage rate, deposit rate, property appreciation, and rent inflation can be adjusted to obtain different results. The mortgage term in this example is 20 years. As you can observe, the buyer and renter have a comparable outcome after 20 years, but the buyer benefits in the long run by not having any mortgage payments. Note that the actual rental cost for a \u00a3400,000 house would likely exceed \u00a31,000, but this example highlights the point of equivalence."}
{"3324": "\n\nThe P/E ratio is a measure of the number of years it would take for a company to earn its share price, calculated by dividing the share price by the annual earnings per share. This can be determined using current quarterly earnings per share multiplied by four, the sum of the past four quarters' actual earnings per share, or projected earnings per share. However, it should be noted that P/E ratio has little to do with a company's actual financial health beyond earnings per share, and is not necessarily an indicator of bankruptcy. Instead, it is mostly a measure of the market's assumptions about the company's ability to grow or maintain earnings. \n\nFor example, a share price of $40 with a P/E ratio of 10 means that the company will take 10 years to earn $40 per share, with current annual earnings per share at $4. Another company may also earn $4 per share but trade at 100 times earnings, with a share price of $400. By this measure, neither company is more or less healthy than the other, but rather, one commands more faith in future growth from the market.\n\nRegarding negative P/E ratios, this signifies that a company is currently reporting negative earnings or running at a loss. Again, this may or may not lead to an imminent bankruptcy. A better way to assess bankruptcy risk would be to look at increasing balance sheet debt alongside decreasing revenue, earnings, and assets."}

However, if you do want to do this, some programs like Gnucash have a \"Closing Books\" feature that transfers income and expenses into an Equity Retained Earnings account. This does not impact your Assets or Liabilities, which would not make sense to close out anyway. If you want to keep each year separate, you could also create a new Gnucash file for each year by exporting and importing the account tree and balances. However, this could make it challenging to run reports across multiple years. In general, though, it is not necessary to close the books as modern accounting software can easily store all of your account data over time.

After filling out necessary paperwork and signing a promissory note, the finance company will issue a check to the supplier for the quoted equipment cost. To obtain approval, potential borrowers must typically provide their social security number and consent to a credit check. It is vital to note that banks typically offer better loan rates than finance companies. Only when credit prevents approval from a bank should people consider using finance companies or borrowing from heating and cooling companies. When possible, it is prudent to save money for items like furniture, cars, clothing, jewelry, and the like rather than taking out personal loans. While there might be circumstances where borrowing is necessary, such as emergency situations like a furnace breaking in winter, using loans for luxury purchases or upgrading appliances is financially unwise."}
{"3337": "\n\nAfter your first payments, you have paid $20,645 and your sister has paid $1,400. However, your sister also owes rent which, estimated at zeroth order, is equal to the mortgage payment of $2,045 (assuming your total payment is not just your escrow payment). This means your sister's net capital contribution is now negative $645. So, you are essentially gifting your sister $7,740 annually while holding sole equity in the property. Fortunately, the gift tax exclusion allows for $14,000 per year, per person, so you and your husband could each claim it separately. This would permit you to add $20,260 to your sister's capital contribution annually, or more if you are willing to pay the gift tax. It is important to note that any losses from the property will fall solely on you, and any profits should be enjoyed solely by you, unless there is a prior agreement in place. If the house's value were to rise to $1,000,000 after a year and you split the profits with your sister 50:50, without paying gift tax, you would be violating tax law."}

Unlike traditional credit cards, using this card to build your credit score does not follow typical rules. Therefore, it is recommended to use the card frequently and pay off the balance regularly to keep your limit available. You can even pay your full balance plus an extra 10% to increase your limit. Requesting a limit increase every three months and using the card often can demonstrate creditworthiness, and the issuer may increase your limit without requiring an additional security deposit after a few months of usage. This method has proven successful in helping your son repair his credit score, as it increased by almost 200 points last year."}

(Although in most countries, there are benefits to filing jointly.) I believe that it would be challenging to make a case for joint filing in your situation. As far as I know, there are no laws prohibiting a landlord-tenant relationship between individuals of opposite sexes, nor are there any laws prohibiting romantic relationships between a landlord and a tenant. In fact, you would need to provide evidence to establish such a relationship. For instance, when determining the date of separation from my soon-to-be-ex-wife, I verified that we did not present as a married couple. This was demonstrated by the fact that we did not sit together at church, and she attended parties that I did not. In reality, proving a romantic relationship is more difficult than proving the opposite."}

If a country is a currency issuer with a floating exchange rate, like the United States, it does not have real debt since it can always print its currency. However, this was not the case before four decades ago when the US was on a gold standard. People still mistakenly believe that currency issuers need to borrow to spend, but this is an outdated view. Countries that do not issue their currencies need to earn or borrow to spend. A state in the US or Greece, borrowing Euros, is the perfect example of this.\n\nInterestingly, a blog titled \"Where Does the Money Come From\" on pragcap.com explores a similar question. The US does not have to borrow money since it creates its currency. The phrase \"Thinking is hard, that's why we don't do it a lot\" from a video sums up the issue nicely."}

However, I caution that this approach may not be suitable for everyone, and it requires discipline and responsible spending habits. Here's how it works for me:\n\nMonth 1: Charge cards and pay the minimum balance, resulting in a modest score increase.\nMonth 2: Pay off all credit cards using cash on hand, resulting in a significant score increase.\nMonth 3: Obtain a credit report showing low balances, charge cards, and pay the minimum balance, while also seeking out credit line extensions and new offers. Be mindful that each credit inquiry may lower your score temporarily.\nMonth 4: Charge cards, pay the minimum balance, and approve discretionary hard pulls (such as for cell phone contracts, car rentals or employment). Keep in mind that too many hard pulls may negatively affect your score.\nMonth 5: Pay off credit cards with cash on hand, ensuring that you maintain a credit utilization ratio of no more than 15% and avoid overleveraging.\nMonth 6: Check your credit report, which will show a slight score decrease from the previous quarter due to the hard pulls, but overall, your score will remain high as long as you continue your responsible financial habits."}

Car loans are considered installment loans, which differ from consumer credit, and creditors tend to value timely repayment over early repayment. Keeping an open line of credit and managing it well is preferred. However, paying off the loan early could result in a temporary small reduction in your credit score due to a hard inquiry lasting up to two years.

The average American carries debt on a car (6-10%), multiple credit cards (ranging from 10-25%), college loans (5-15%), signature loans (8-15%), or secured bank loans (4-8%). To begin, stop living beyond your means and incurring more debt. This might mean cutting back on non-essential expenses, such as cable. Use tax returns and savings from reducing expenses to pay off large debts.

By reducing your debt now, you will lower long-term expenditures and make it easier to afford the cost of higher education."}

{"3359": "\n\nUpon reading your responses to the comments, it appears that you remain convinced that obtaining 0% credit is always possible and that nothing negative will ever come from it. However, it's important to note that credit cards offering 0% balance transfers are quite rare, and most of them have transfer fees that act similarly to interest rates. This change likely occurred about a decade ago, without much attention. It's vital to learn from this experience and consider future changes in the financial sphere. Many websites recount disastrous credit scenarios where individuals played a dangerous game of musical chairs with their credit, only to find themselves without anywhere to sit when the music stopped. Life changes such as job loss, medical bills, natural disasters, and unexpected taxes can all impact someone's ability to make timely payments. Late payments can start a downward spiral that can have long-term negative consequences, both financially and mentally. This is first-hand knowledge gained through experience shared by me and my loved ones - it's not worth the suffering. Therefore, it is advisable to get out of debt as soon as possible.\n\nYou mentioned investing the money instead of paying off the debt and how you are making a 7% delta between your prevailing investment rate. However, your calculations likely did not include the balance transfer fee. Please note that investments do not always yield profits. For instance, 2015 was mostly flat, and we haven't seen a significant market correction in a long time, which many say is long overdue. Additionally, you need to consider the amount of money you are investing. For example, let's say there is no balance transfer fee, and you can guarantee a 7% return. Suppose you are floating $10k; in this ideal scenario, you earn $700. However, if $700 is a significant sum, you might need to consider getting a second job that pays that amount every two weeks - this could be life-changing. Finally, evaluate the opportunities that you're missing by using so much mental energy to earn $700, which is better spent elsewhere. Ultimately, it's best to pay off debts as soon as possible as it has long-term benefits."}
{"3360": "In the 19th and early 20th centuries, monopolies called \"Trusts\" were a problem, which is why we have antitrust laws today. These trusts used their considerable influence to control both customers and suppliers. They were not created to evade taxes; in fact, trusts existed before permanent income taxes were introduced. While temporary income taxes were used to pay for wars, people evaded taxes by shifting expenses from personal to business or charity expenses. Businesses paid for travel, meals, and other expenses, while charities paid for promotional activities. To pay employees, one could fund a charitable organization and use the money to pay them. One could even declare their home a historical landmark and have a charity maintain it. These tax evasion tactics no longer work since the IRS is now more vigilant in tracking personal expenditures disguised as business expenses. Tax policies have also changed, so some tactics no longer work, and other places have even fewer tax regulations to adhere to. \n\nIt is uncertain if tax evasion would be omnipresent again if the US returns to the high tax rates of the 1950s or 1970s.

For instance, in the UK, shares valued at \u00a32000 are treated differently from cash vested, with restricted stocks or options only becoming available for sale or exercise years after they were granted, provided the employee fulfills their contract by staying with the same employer through the vesting period. This incentivizes employees to remain with their employer, with job retention being the priority, rather than exercising the same day.

Currently, one of the few investment options that still provides reliable profits with reasonable risk is real estate.

This has made it an opportune time to take out a loan to purchase a home, leading to high demand and driving up the prices in the area. It is important to note that investing in real estate does not necessarily mean you have to buy a property, as investing in a real estate fund is an option. By investing in an immobilienfond, you own a portion of many properties, which helps to spread out the risk and enables flexible investment amounts. However, it is essential to recognize that these funds can be less liquid, with the two-year hold requirement and the one-year selling announcement obligation. Additionally, investing in real estate carries risk, as the current surge in prices could indicate a potential real estate bubble. This is still a highly debated topic among financial analysts. Finally, when the European Central Bank begins to raise interest rates once again, demand for real estate may drop, causing prices to fall as well.

{"3367": "\n\nIt appears that you have a misconception about why you are mostly paying interest in the first year of your loan. The primary reason for this is that the principal amount that you owe is at its highest during the initial year. Although you will make some progress in paying down the principal during this time, it will only have a minor impact on your overall interest owed. However, with each passing year, you will see a reduction in the principal amount owed, resulting in less interest due.\n\nYour payments will remain consistent throughout the loan term, but as the principal amount decreases, a higher portion of each payment will go towards reducing the principal. This process of reducing your principal amount year after year is similar to compounding interest, but it is actually compounded principal reduction.\n\nIt's important to note that the reduction of your principal amount will not have any effect on the interest owed during the first 15 years in your case, as you did not start to reduce your principle until the 16th year.\n\nTo provide some specific numbers, let's say you have a $100,000 loan with a 3% interest rate, and you pay $5,000 annually (paying annually will keep things straightforward). In the first year, you will put $3,000 towards interest and $2,000 towards principal. By the end of the 30th year, you will have put $145 towards interest and $4,855 towards principal. Since your principal amount is so small at this point, your interest owed will also be quite minor.\n\nTherefore, it is essential to understand that the amount of interest paid in any given year of a loan is not solely determined by the length of the loan but is instead largely influenced by the principal amount still owed."}

For SPY, NAV is usually very close due to the high number of participants. While the Management Expense Ratio (MER) is noteworthy, tracking error outweighs it. Tracking error considers the MER, trading expenses, and revenue from securities lending. To date, SPY has displayed a lower tracking error than the MER, which is not significant in price variances. When it comes to ES, it is the present price paid to receive SPX in the future (with cash settlement). Fair value must take into account dividends and interest.

{"3371": "\n\nThe scope of stop and trailing stop orders available to you will largely depend on your broker. However, it is worth noting that I have yet to come across a broker that offers limit orders in combination with trailing stop orders. Typically, trailing stop orders are only offered as market orders, whereby you can specify either a dollar value or a percentage from the recent high. Please be aware that trailing stops are based on intra-day highs and do not take into account the highest closing price. As a precaution, you may find it useful to base trailing stops on the highest closing price by using standard stop loss orders and adjusting them accordingly based on this metric after the close of trade. While this may require additional effort, it provides you with more control and enables you to attach limit orders to your stop loss triggers. This also allows you to avoid keeping your trailing stop too close to the most recent high price and hence getting stopped out prematurely.\n\nOn a slightly different note, some brokers offer Trailing Take Profit Orders as a tool for range traders. Here, you can specify your trailing take profit trigger at or near recent resistance levels, making it easier to exit if prices start reversing in that zone. By using this order, you can incur additional profits if the price breaks through the resistance barrier. For example, if you set a profit target of 50% and buy a security at $2, you could set your Trailing Take Profit Trigger at $3.10 or above, with a trail by amount of $0.10. Doing so would allow you to exit at $3.00 if the price falls after hitting $3.10 or exit at $3.20 if it hits $3.30 and falls to $3.20. The Trailing Take Profit order will continue to move up, always $0.10 below the highest price reached."}

Therefore, it is important to consult with a CA-licensed EA/CPA to understand how to resolve this issue. Based on the information provided, it appears that there are no other taxable events. While the IRS does not generally consider LLCs as significant entities, it is always advisable to seek the advice of a professional, such as a CPA/EA licensed in your state, when in doubt."}
{"3376": "\n\n\nThe IRS provides a specific definition for income. When it comes to taxable vs nontaxable income, they state that income can be received in the form of money, property or services. The IRS also discusses numerous kinds of income that are taxable, including employee wages and benefits, as well as income from bartering, partnerships, S corporations, and royalties. In the case of bartering, which involves an exchange of property or services, it is subject to taxation at fair market value. Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, provides comprehensive details on all types of income.\n\nIt is important to note that if your employer pays you in virtual currency such as Bitcoin, it is considered income and must be reported accordingly. The same goes for payment in gold or foreign currency. The fair market value is the determining factor for calculating taxable income. It is advised to keep track of prices for each pay period to determine the total fair value of your pay. If you fail to report this income, you must file an amended return using Form 1040X. Further information on the subject is available in Tax Topic 420 - Bartering Income and Barter Exchanges."}

If this right is exercised, the shares will be exchanged for principal plus a sweetener and/or less a penalty. However, only shares that are matched by the employer have retraction privileges, while unmatched shares do not qualify. It is important to thoroughly read all contracts. The retraction privilege essentially allows for a way to \"cash out\" of preferred shares. Additionally, shareholders are granted the consent to resale, which gives them the power to resell the retracted shares. If consent is granted, the corporation is authorized to sell the shares to another party. If consent is withheld, the corporation must retire the shares and issue new ones to maintain the same number of shares outstanding.

{"3381": "\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing a company's profit (or loss) by the number of outstanding shares. It is important to compare this figure to the share price; for example, an EPS of $1 and a share price of $10 means that the EPS represents 10% of the share price. This indicates that, if the company maintains this level of profit, you can expect to earn 10% annually on your investment in the long run. While stock prices may fluctuate, a profitable company will eventually lead to profits for its investors.\n\nA low EPS is seen as an opportunity for growth, either through increased profit margins or expected business expansion. However, investing in companies expected to grow carries risk, as slow growth can lead to financial losses for investors. It is important to note that the listed EPS, like other key figures, is based on the last financial statement, and changes in market expectations may occur following recent developments. Additionally, some companies experience high fluctuations in their earnings; for example, movie or video game production companies may see large incomes following a new release, but lower earnings during other periods. It is necessary to examine long-term data when determining a company's profitability."}
{"3382": "\n\nIf you trade CFDs using margin, you will typically be subject to an overnight financing fee for long positions held overnight and an overnight financing credit for short positions held overnight. Most CFD brokers base their overnight financing rates on the country's official interest rates, with rates usually set at + or - 2.5% or 3%. For example, if your country's official interest rate is 5% and your broker uses + or - 2.5%, you will pay a 7.5% fee for long positions held overnight and receive a 2.5% credit for short positions held overnight.\n\nIn Australia, the official interest rate is currently 2.5%, meaning that traders will pay a 5% fee for long positions held overnight and receive 0% for short positions held overnight. If you plan on holding positions long-term, especially long positions, it may be wise to consider alternatives to CFDs since the interest fees can add up over time. Keep in mind that these fees are charged on borrowed funds, and if you were to buy shares directly, you would not be subject to such overnight financing fees."}

I anticipate that prices may decrease further, making purchasing easier the longer you wait. Once prices reach rock bottom, and you are confident they will not decrease further, then it may be worth taking a risk. It's important to note that if housing prices continue to rise, selling your property to gain the increased value is an option, even if you lose your job and cannot pay.

This variability makes it difficult to use these indicators in future predictions. Moreover, after over 30 years of experience, I have yet to come across any strategy that consistently identifies market tops in real time.

Notably, while common shares allow for voting rights, preferred shares do not. I would advise against owning shares in a company due to the potential risk involved.

In the case of a joint account that requires both account holders' signatures to make withdrawals, both parties' signature endorsements will likely be required for making deposits, such as receiving a tax refund from the U.S. Treasury or any check payable to both parties. Multi-party account ownership may lead to complications between cashing or depositing a joint check and account tax ID number. Upon opening the account, you will need to specify who can make deposits and withdrawals, and at least one party must be present with appropriate identification (probably tax ID or Social Security number). If there are three or more owners, you may need to open a business or commercial account due to the extra expense of administering an account with more than two signatories. North Carolina general banking statutes have specific rules for joint accounts, where two or more people can establish a deposit account, and the deposit and any balance shall be held as joint tenants. You will need to tell the bank explicitly what permissions you want for your joint account, and joint account terms are similar everywhere in North Carolina.

However, three years later, I received a letter alleging that I had an unpaid parking ticket. It appeared that the record of dismissal had been lost, but the record of the ticket being issued remained. I suspect that this occurs because legal entities may lose electronic records, restore data from backups without realizing that some data remains lost, or transition to new systems without properly transferring all real-world events. Unfortunately, the people you interact with often have no idea of these technical issues. Luckily, I had kept paperwork that showed I had received a judgement of dismissal. But what would you do if the state had lost all electronic records of your payments, and a collections agency has a record that you owe the ticket amount, while the state claims no record exists of your payment? In this case, you could compile a list of all possible banks you may have used, and request duplicate statements. Assuming you were a regular consumer, this should not take more than 100 pages or so. If you find the transactions in those records, you can consult a lawyer. States are not immune from lawsuits, so by fraudulently claiming you defaulted on payments, the state has caused you material harm, which a lawyer can help you handle. Getting the paperwork is hard enough, and finding someone in the state to listen to you and compensate you for your time and expenses is even harder.

{"3408": "\n\nIf you are employed by a company in a tax haven and they provide your services to another employer, the tax haven company receives payment instead of you. This company may not even have to pay you since they can give you a tax-exempt loan. Although you don't pay tax on a loan, you are required to repay it at a rate the company deems acceptable. Sometimes the company may even write off the loan as unrecoverable. In such cases, you may not have paid any tax on the loaned money. However, the tax authorities may see this as a deliberate attempt to evade taxes, which is illegal. So, it's important to have evidence showing that the loans were taken out to supplement income and not as part of a tax scam. This proof can be expensive and requires hiring professional tax counsel. Sometimes, these tax loopholes exist because the number of people using them isn't enough to justify enforcement. Other times, a scheme may have been perfectly legal at some point in the past. For example, the government once recommended offshore education trusts to save tax, but now the law has changed. In some cases, there may be a retrospective tax charge, as happened with the 75% tax rate on certain accounts proposed by Gordon Brown. This was met with opposition from MPs who regarded it as retrospective taxation, and a loophole was created for a penalty-free return of funds. Imagine if a future Chancellor were to declare ISAs as evil and impose retrospective tax on dividends and capital gains from past decades, even if the ISA was underperforming.

{"3411": "\n\nWhile some may argue that understanding derivatives, particularly options trading, is intuitive, I personally find it to be quite complex. Often, the price is either \"in the money\" or not, in which an option that is out of the money only has time value. As the price of a stock increases and the option becomes more valuable, the time value decreases. For instance, a $40 strike price for a $40 stock may seem like a bet that the stock will rise, with no intrinsic value, and an option with a strike of $30 may have more premium with the intrinsic value at $10.68 and only $.68 in time premium. A calculator online may help one comprehend these complex trades. \n\nOne crucial consideration in options trading is volatility. Even if a stock rises at a steady rate, without much fluctuation, buying an option that is 10% out of the money would be futile. It's akin to looking at a bell curve, where there is a slim one-sixth chance of an event happening above a standard deviation. Thus, if the standard deviation is small, the likelihood of striking higher goals is also slight.\n\nI've written an article, \"Betting on Apple at 9 to 2,\" which details a pair of option trades set up with the aim of securing a 354% return if Apple's stock experience a 35% rise in two years. I offer this example to prove that options trading is not merely theoretical but practical, with many engaged in it. The trade on Apple intrigued me because its high volatility meant that a 35% increase wouldn't be the 4.5 to 1 risk that the market predicted. Currently, Apple needs to rise by at least 13% in ten months for this trade to yield a return. However, I must disclose that the extended time to expiration is both favorable and not; while it provides ample opportunity to recover a 35% loss, anything happening globally in two years may impact Apple's market negatively. Hence, the average investor may lack the patience required for long-term option trades."}

Furthermore, only shares sold at a loss are considered under the wash sale, not shares sold for a gain.

{"3419": "\n\nAlthough the original question is specific, I will provide a general answer. The concern is determining the deductible travel expenses for a location over 1000 miles away. Typically, \"necessary and ordinary\" expenses are deductible for both businesses and rentals. However, what is considered necessary and ordinary? For instance, is it normal for a landlord to manage a property 1000 miles away by themselves every day, or is it typical for individuals to drive 1000 miles every week? The answer would be no to both situations. It would be more cost-effective to hire a local property manager, and flying may be cheaper than driving. Additionally, if the taxpayer claims 1000 miles is necessary and ordinary, they will need to justify it to the IRS examiner during an audit. Generally, the IRS allows one trip per year per property, and exceptional situations require justification. All expenses must be documented, including gas, hotel, and flight receipts. Personal expenses are not deductible, so any trip must be mainly business-related. However, if some pleasure is involved, the costs must be split accordingly. If a trip is necessary for checking out the property before purchase, it is an investment or business expense.

{"3420": "\n\nI believe that one of the main reasons why real estate is often considered a bad investment is due to the substantial changes in housing prices, which are significantly greater compared to the initial down payment required. Unfortunately, this situation is not uncommon, and it is not even the worst-case scenario of being underwater in your mortgage. Imagine the overwhelming disappointment and frustration of buying a home only to be burdened by debt, instead of fulfilling your dream of homeownership."}
{"3421": "\n\nA better version might be:\n\nA good starting point in researching a company is to examine its \"Balance Sheet\" (B/S), which will provide the total number of outstanding shares. Although the quarterly B/S may not be audited, it is still a reliable starting point. To incorporate any quantitative analysis, it is necessary to consider the growth of the outstanding shares number. Companies may issue shares to their employees without filing, which could yield inaccuracies in the total number of outstanding shares. Moreover, the exact number of outstanding shares is difficult to determine since stock options that are out of the money may not be taken into account. While some companies do consider this, others do not. It is also important to understand the concept of \"fully dilute\" shares and \"basis\" shares, which may impact calculations if the company has convertible bonds."}

Your existing homeowners, renters, car, and travel insurance policies should be sufficient. Additionally, it is important to note that an umbrella policy provides additional coverage on top of existing policies, rather than replacing them.

{"3424": "\n\nThe appearance of incomplete or inaccurate financial data on free sites is mainly due to the complexity and cost involved in obtaining and parsing this information. One hurdle is that financial data is often handled by different authorities, even within the same country. For instance, in the US, stock prices and volumes come from one authority (CQS) while corporate earnings data comes from another (SEC). Meanwhile, futures and options data is only available from individual exchanges, each with its own interface, ranging from websites to FTPs and TCP datastreams. Gathering, parsing, and error-checking all this data on a frequent basis is a demanding task, especially as this involves exchanges and regulatory agencies worldwide.\n\nThere are companies such as Bloomberg that specialize in gathering and processing such data. They invest millions in maintaining the necessary infrastructure and manpower, charging their consumers accordingly. The question is, do Google/Yahoo access Bloomberg's data for free to show us information or do they pay for a less comprehensive dataset? Even if they pay for the best data available, errors can still occur or disruptions might take place in the data streams. Bloomberg has hundreds of employees focused on this task alone, whereas Yahoo may have only five.\n\nThe lesson is clear: if you are in need of the best financial data, you must go to the source or pay a provider that can offer you access and support when something goes wrong.

{"3425": "\n\nI have not thoroughly examined the warranty, but in general, it can be helpful. Are you familiar with GAP insurance? In the case of a total loss, GAP insurance covers the outstanding finance balance after your regular insurance payout. Usually, the two amounts do not match due to the vehicle's depreciation right after purchase. For example, suppose you finance $20,000 to buy a car and then write it off after six months. In that case, your insurance payout may only be valued at $16,000, but it is unlikely you will have cleared $4,000 from your finance. GAP insurance will cover the difference and settle the debt.  Do you know if Chrysler will change the engine if it fails? Yes, unless they identify misuse or deliberate damage. For instance, if the engine fails after just 1000 miles and it's a mechanical fault, the warranty would cover it. However, if they find evidence of reckless driving during diagnostics or engine investigation, they may refuse to cover the damages, and you will have to prove it was an underlying fault. Are car dents covered by the bumper to bumper warranty? It is unlikely as the warranty only covers the manufacturer's faults, not your negligent actions. I think there is confusion between the terms insurance and warranty. While insurance covers damages caused by you, a warranty covers manufacturer faults even with extended coverage. What does \"basic\" mean under warranty terms? It depends on Chrysler's definition. There is no universal legal definition of \"basic.\" You need to check the warranty documents or ask for a detailed explanation from the dealer. If they are unwilling to provide clarity, it probably covers very little."}

However, these two factors are inversely correlated. Imagine if interest rates were 5% higher, few people would be able to afford current prices, leading to a drop in prices. To draw comparisons, we need to consider the rate of inflation, which was much higher in certain periods of US history, such as over 10% in 1980. Therefore, we cannot solely rely on nominal interest rates. Additionally, investing your entire future income into real estate is unwise. Instead, consider purchasing REITs with a lesser investment, to diversify your portfolio. Another cost factor that renters often underestimate is maintenance costs.\n\nReasons to Buy a House: If you desire the security of having a permanent home, then buying a house becomes a lifestyle choice. You can remodel and renovate the property as per your requirements. Another reason is that housing prices may increase, presenting an opportunity for profit. However, it's generally not advisable to rely on speculation as a strategy for making money. Finally, while interest rates may increase, it is likely that the Fed will try to keep them below 10% to avoid defaulting on government debts. However, there is no certainty in this area."}

Unfortunately, my own cap loss has been exhausted due to the dot com bubble. Hopefully, you'll be able to offset any losses quickly with new gains.

It may be worthwhile to inquire with the IRS if they have any other payment plans available, as the standard plan goes up to 5 years which may end up being a hefty $40k/yr. It is possible to negotiate with the IRS, so don't hesitate to ask. In the past, I've heard of cases where individuals exercised stock grants, but retained ownership of shares. Although they had a gain of $1M at year-end, the stock plummeted before the year's end, leaving them with nothing to offset the loss.

{"3431": "Congratulations on your windfall! You have been given a second chance to start anew and become debt-free again. To maintain this freedom, I offer the following advice:\n\nFirstly, commit to remaining debt-free. You have already done so by asking for help. Avoid borrowing or spending money you don't have on credit, and never take out loans.\n\nNext, learn to budget. Knowing the exact amount of money coming in and going out each month is essential. At the start of each month, write down your income and expenses, including fixed, variable, and ongoing costs. Use budgeting software like YNAB to make the process easier. You may need to adjust your expenses or increase your income to stay within your budget, but be sure not to spend money outside of it.\n\nIf you struggle to cover your expenses, review your budget, and see where you can cut back on unnecessary expenses like food or entertainment. If you still can't make ends meet, consider increasing your income with a part-time job. You can find a job that complements your study schedule, helping you avoid taking on more debt.\n\nFinally, build up a small emergency fund. Emergencies are inevitable, so having some money set aside for this purpose will help prevent you from borrowing money when they arise. As a college student, a small fund of $500-$1000 should suffice.\n\nBy following these steps, you can remain debt-free and enjoy financial freedom."}
{"3432": "\n\nWhen considering purchasing a Put option, it is important to examine the associated cost, particularly if the strike price coincides with the current price, as well as to take into account the average price delta of the security during the period between the purchase of the Put and the expiration date. Prices for Puts on stocks with a high level of price volatility should also be closely scrutinized. It is worth noting that there may be instances where the use of a Put option may lead to unfavourable outcomes. For example, if the stock remains at the same price, the premium paid for the Put will be lost. Similarly, if the stock price increases by an amount less than the premium, the difference will also be lost. If the stock price falls by an amount less than the premium, the difference will be lost as well. \n\nTo be \"in the money\" when using a protective Put, the stock must either increase in price by an amount greater than the premium paid (at which point selling or holding and deducting the cost of the Put are the viable options), or the stock price must drop below the strike price to a level below the premium paid, at which point exercising the option to sell is necessary in order to prevent losses (assuming that one had planned to sell instead of hold and hope for recovery). It is also worth noting that in both cases, selling is mandatory. If the stock has been held for less than a year, profits will be taxed at the short-term rate (the same rate as regular income). In the event that the stock price has fallen, it may not be possible to claim a loss unless the strike price was lower than the purchase price of the stock. Additionally, it may not be possible to claim a deduction for the cost of the Put."}

For instance, I subsisted on a diet of beans and rice twice daily for two years (generous in protein and other nutrients) while working full-time and simultaneously pursuing a second degree part-time. I also avoided frivolous expenses, like recreational activities (not even a movie), in order to redirect finances towards achieving academic goals. Additionally, during a separate season of my life, I eliminated cable, cell phone, and landline services (relying solely on Skype), and limited my driving to reduce debt. You'll be surprised at how much you can conserve from a budget if you embrace temporary austerity.\n\nc) Consider enrolling in school part-time, with the option of taking as few as one course per term, where applicable.

For example, if we buy a 75-cent Coke from a vending machine using a dollar bill and receive a quarter as change, we record it as a $1.00 expense. On the other hand, we don't track expenses when using three quarters to purchase the same drink because we consider spending coins as \"free money.\" This approach works well for us because we don't use cash frequently, and we find it easier to match the cash in our wallet with our YNAB balance. We don't count coins we have in the car or the dish on our dresser either. Despite this method, our bank balances remain precise down to the penny."}

Age is not a significant factor in determining acceptable volatility, as it is more important to consider when the money will be needed.

For example, a person close to retirement age with $250K in CDs and savings and $250K in conservative investments should be \"aggressive\" with any remaining money. In contrast, someone saving for a house within three years should be conservative, with 75% in savings accounts and 25% in conservative investments.

Currently, interest rates are low, and it may not make sense to put 20% down on a home. Investing in a different vehicle could be a better option, especially considering the global economy is likely to pick up, and interest rates should remain low.

The second is a credit vertical, which involves selling a 460 put and buying a 430 put. If an individual anticipates that Apple's stock will drop to 460, there are several options available. However, the three most common strategies are as follows: 1) Purchase a put option. This approach can be costly, and if the stock only drops to 460, it may be overpriced. 2) Purchase a put vertical. This approach is less expensive than the first because the cost of the put is offset. 3) Purchase a butterfly. This approach is the most economical because it includes the second vertical in addition to a credit vertical, which offsets the expense. \n\nThe reason someone may choose to use the butterfly method is to save money upfront while profiting from a drop to 460. This would be the most effective strategy if the trader's assumptions are correct. It's important to remember that every strategy has trade-offs that the trader must consider carefully. If the trader is mistaken and Apple declines to, say, 400, the put (strategy #1) will be the most profitable, the butterfly (strategy #3) will lose money, while the vertical (strategy #2) will still earn some profits. Therefore, to reap the butterfly's benefits, traders must be willing to make sacrifices. Creating a diagram to compare these strategies can be a helpful tool."}

Furthermore, each state varies in their approach to LLCs, and legal and tax considerations differ depending on the state one resides in. When considering contractor versus employee status, it is necessary to weigh the pros and cons of each option. Contractors must set higher rates to compensate for benefits forgone, in addition to the cost of establishing and maintaining an LLC, which can amount to at least $800 per year in California, not counting legal and accounting expenses. Employee benefits, particularly health insurance, should be taken into account when considering the relative value. Should the decision be to contract, forming a single-member LLC is advisable as it offers several benefits such as enhanced legal credibility for contractors, offers legal protection, and is a minimal paperwork option. While the IRS and Department of Labor still closely scrutinize contractor relationships, having an LLC can boost legal credentials. Additionally, forming an LLC is a good way to safeguard one's personal assets from any lawsuits or liabilities resulting from business dealings. A business license is also often necessary for contractors, and there may be separate licensing requirements in each city where one conducts business.

This can result in unusually high dividend yields, but it's just a result of the company's structure. \n\nIt's important to evaluate a company's ability to keep paying a dividend.

The key is to provide a large enough downpayment so that the seller knows they will recoup their money if they have to foreclose. Furthermore, this provides the seller with a means of selling a difficult-to-sell house and generating regular income. While this mortgage may only be for 3-10 years, it provides time to establish credit and then refinance. Interest rates may be somewhat higher, but that is only until you can refinance to a more favorable rate, or sell other assets to pay off the loan quickly. \n\nFor new homes, builders and developers may offer similar financing terms. With both owner-will-carry and developer financing, a substantial deposit can override any credit rating concerns. Additionally, there is usually a streamlined foreclosure process, so they are not taking much risk and can afford to be flexible. To ensure that both parties adhere to their respective obligations, it is important to ensure that the owner mortgage is facilitated via a title company, trust company, or escrow company as a third party to oversee the transaction."}
{"3462": "\n\nThe Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company was first established as a private company in 1902. While it raised public funds around 1903, its shareholder base remained limited. It was reported as being tradeable as an OTC (over-the-counter) stock by around 1929, although shares were likely traded prior to this. On January 14th, 1946, the stock was listed on NYSE, and on September 26th, 1962, it became a constituent of the S&P 500 index. On August 9th, 1976, it became a constituent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and in 2002, the company changed its name to 3M Co.\n\nThere seems to be an error with the data on Crunchbase's \"IPO Date,\" as it is inconsistent with other sources. However, it is not uncommon for companies to trade publicly prior to their initial public offering (IPO), particularly early-stage biotech companies that trade OTC prior to a major exchange listing. For example, NASDAQ:IMRN (Immuron) and NASDAQ:GNTY (Guaranty Banchshares Inc) both had \"IPOs\" on Nasdaq after trading as OTC/pink sheet stocks for months prior.\n\nUltimately, the term \"initial\" is subjective in this context, as companies may have a range of trading histories before their official IPO."}

{"3473": "\n\nAs a new small business owner, the IRS has a wealth of advice and information available for you. Start by visiting https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed. Be sure to prepare yourself with coffee or other appropriate aid to combat fatigue. If you have a single-member LLC, it is automatically \"disregarded\" for tax purposes, at least on a federal level. Although it does have other effects, you should simply include your business income and expenses on Schedule C as part of your individual return on form 1040, and the net self-employment income is included with your other income in computing your tax. TurboTax or similar software should handle this for you, but you may require a premium version that will cost a little extra. You can \"elect\" to have the LLC taxed as a corporation by filing form 8832; see https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc. You are supposed to do this when the entity is \"formed,\" but in practice, if you file by the end of the year, there should be no issues. You also qualify for automatic \"relief\" if you file after the end of the year, but before or with your first affected return. However, deciding how to divide the business income/profits into \"reasonable pay\" versus \"dividends\" is more complicated. Plus, filling out corporation tax returns in addition to your individual return is more work. Additionally, the cost of filing and reporting the LLC itself to your state of choice is required. Unless you make something like $50k-100k a year, this approach probably isn't worth it. \n\nRegarding 1099 Reporting, Stripe qualifies as a \"payment network.\" Under recent law, payment networks must report annually to the IRS (and copy to you) on form 1099-K if your account exceeds specific thresholds. Please visit https://support.stripe.com/questions/will-i-receive-a-1099-k-and-what-do-i-do-with-it. However, you are still legally required to report and pay tax on your self-employment income even if you aren't covered by 1099-K or any other reporting.\n\nAs a self-employed individual, you must pay \"SE\" tax that is the equivalent of \"FICA\" taxes that would be paid by your employer and you as an employee combined. This is 12.4% for Social Security, unless your total earned income exceeds a cap (for 2017 $127,200, adjusted every year for inflation), and 2.9% for Medicare with no limit (plus an \"Additional Medicare\" tax if you exceed a higher threshold, and it isn't \"repealed and replaced\"). If the LLC elects corporation status, it must pay you reasonable wages for your services and withhold+pay FICA on those wages like any other employer. \n\nFor estimated payments, you are required to pay most of your individual income tax and SE tax, if applicable, during the year (generally 90% of your tax or your tax minus $1,000, whichever is less). Most wage-earners do not notice this because it happens automatically through payroll withholding. However, as a self-employed individual, it is your responsibility to make sufficient and timely estimated payments. You will owe a penalty if you do not. However, since this is your first year, you may have a \"safe harbor.\" Suppose you also have income from an employer (reported on W-2, with withholding) and that withholding is enough to pay the previous year's tax. In that case, you are exempt from the \"underpayment\" penalty for this year.\n\nIf you elect corporation status, the corporation (which is really just you) must always make timely payments of withheld amounts, according to one of several different schedules that may apply depending on the amounts. I believe it also must make estimated payments for its liability, if any, but I'm not familiar with that part."}

It is true that diamonds sold for under $5000 at their original retail price have no secondary market and are essentially worthless. However, diamonds that are considered actual investment stones can have real value, although this market is fragile and limited to stones worth six figures or more. The confusion arises because people are not distinguishing between the two markets.\n\nThe so-called \"engagement ring scam market\" is a different story; these diamonds are essentially worthless and cannot be sold for any significant amount of money. They are subject to marketing and monopolies that ratchet up their prices but don't correspond to any real value. Moreover, the technology for making utterly flawless diamonds from carbon is getting better every decade, putting more pressures on the diamond market.\n\nFinally, diamonds get beat up and are like used cars, which means that used engagement ring diamonds have zero value. Conversely, investment diamonds are a distinct market that is unrelated to the engagement ring scam system.

{"3477": "There is one specific model that credit card companies use to maximize their profits: per transaction fees. In addition, they also receive incentives from certain merchants and use psychological reasoning to promote their card usage. Businesses that want to accept credit card payments typically have to pay three types of fees: monthly/yearly subscription fees, percentage of transaction fees, and per transaction fees. Subscription fees can sometimes be waived, and the percentage of transaction fee is usually around 1-3%. The per transaction fee is a set fee incurred every time a transaction is run involving a card, usually ranging from $0.05 to $0.30 per transaction. \n\nCredit card companies prefer customers who use their products regularly and for smaller amounts. They offer rewards on gas and groceries to encourage this behavior, which also reduces their expenses on rewards paid out. However, credit card companies can avoid paying some or all of the cost of rewards when merchants themselves honor rewards in exchange for reduced or zero payment from the card companies. \n\nWhile the credit card industry's business model may be profitable, it often involves shenanigans such as black-out periods, expiring rewards, and high annual fees. Despite this, credit card companies continue to encourage the use of their cards for regular, small purchases like gas and groceries to maximize their profits."}

{"3481": "\n\nRevised: Saving for retirement should continue until you have accumulated enough to retire comfortably. While it is advisable to make the most of your 401k, it is not mandatory to have all your \"retirement savings\" in it. However, it is important to take advantage of employer matching programs, if available, even if they place limits on contributions. Contributing the maximum allowable amount to your 401k plan is a prudent step towards securing a comfortable retirement, given that people nowadays tend to live longer. Social security alone may not be adequate to sustain retirees, so it is important to have a personal savings plan that enables you to accumulate sufficient funds to live comfortably in your retirement years. A good rule of thumb is to aim to save 25 times your current income, adjusted for inflation, by the time you retire at age 62. For instance, if you make $100,000 annually, your target retirement savings are approximately $2.5 million, plus allowance for inflation between now and retirement. Besides saving as much as possible, it is essential to explore other ways to increase your income, such as passive investing. Financial advisors may be helpful, but their services may not be necessary unless you have substantial assets to invest, typically over $1 million."}

Similarly, investing in one medium-sized boat, such as a stock market stock, still poses a risk of sinking. On the other hand, investing all of your money in a supertanker, such as the stock of a multinational corporation, may lessen the risk of sinking but also decreases the possibility of winning. Investing in a fleet, like a fund, may be more beneficial as it limits the risk of sinking and ensures reaching the shore. \n\nInvesting your money can be time-consuming, and you may not possess sufficient money to create your own portfolio or fleet. Thus, investing in a fund may be more practical. However, not all funds are created equal.

Most major banks offer TFSA accounts, such as Scotia iTrade, HSBC Invest Direct, and TD. You will need to provide your bank account details to facilitate money transfers/TFSA contributions.\n\nWhen purchasing foreign shares, you need to consider the potential of high foreign exchange spreads, which can be excessive in proportion to the investment. HSBC offers the best spreads on FX, but you need to exchange a minimum of $10,000 to obtain a decent spread. It's also important to note that you can buy unhedged ETFs for US and European markets on the Toronto exchange, which means you're paying next to nothing on the spread, but you're still carrying the currency risk.\n\nIt's essential to consider that commissions for trades on foreign markets may be higher than those on a Canadian exchange. For example, HSBC charges a flat rate of $6.88 for both Toronto and New York trades, but for London, they charge up to 0.5% depending on the size of the trade. There may also be additional trading costs on some foreign exchanges. For instance, London has a 0.5% stamp duty on purchases.\n\nFinally, if you're holding US securities, you'll need to register with the US tax authorities and with the US exchanges upon which you're trading. You'll need to fill out numerous forms provided by your stockbroker, and the exchange registrations can be done electronically. However, US tax authority registration must be submitted in writing. Dividends are net of US withholding taxes, and there are no capital gains reporting requirements to the US authorities."}

{"3502": "\n\nRevised: If the OP is already saving 33% of their current income, they may not require more income from investments at the moment. The advice on diversifying may be a standard response given by investment advisors to beginners, but it has two benefits for the advisor, namely, they cannot be sued for giving poor advice, and they can make a substantial commission by selling average-performance products. Note that these products are not necessarily good investment opportunities, as advisors earn bonuses for selling more products, not necessarily good ones. \n\nInstead, my recommendation would be to put some of the excess income (around 1/3 or 1/4) into the emerging market sector, leaving it untouched for up to 20 or 30 years. Chances are there will inevitably be another EM boom in the future, given human nature. During that time, you can sell and utilize those profits in a less risky investment sector. Additionally, it may be worth considering putting another slice of the excess income into the commodities sector, such as oil, despite the uncertainty of when the price will reach $150 or $200 a barrel. Since the OP has sufficient income and is young, it may be an ideal time to adopt a risky investment strategy. Even if you lose your entire investment over the next five years, you still have 20 years to recover from that. However, if you're beginning at 56 years of age, the risk/reward situation would undoubtedly differ."}

Generally, it is essential to gather more information before initiating any action when someone mentions \"security codes or something.\" Imagine the possibilities here. Your relative may be deceived, and in such a case, assisting them in transferring money to the scammer is not the right kind of help. Despite your confidence in your relative's honesty, the dark side may have lured them. If they are doing something illegal, getting involved is not wise. Your friends and relatives should never ask you to commit crimes for them, especially in a way that may lead to you paying a penalty if something goes wrong. If what is going on is legal and ethical, you may still make yourself accountable for taxes, fees, or any other liabilities, and you should know them upfront. As stated by @Grade'eh'bacon, if your relative is experiencing password problems or an expired account, feel free to assist them in resolving it. However, becoming someone's financial mediator may result in many potential issues."}
{"3504": "I am an Australian investor who purchased five properties between 2008 and 2010. My strategy was to buy properties with positive cash flow that didn't require significant upfront investment. Given the high Australian dollar at the time, the depressed US property market, and the expensive market in Australia, investing in the US made sense. I used an investment website to screen properties based on yield, eliminating outliers, and ultimately chose Toledo, Ohio due to its high yield performance and significant impact from the housing crisis.\n\nMy first property was a duplex in good condition with a monthly rental income of $900 US, guaranteed by section 8 and direct deposited into my bank account. Taxes were $900 a year, and the water bill was $450 a year, resulting in a total return of around $8,000 US. My second property was a short sale of a tenanted single-family home in good condition that cost $8,000 US and returned a monthly gross rental income of $600 US. Taxes and water bills were both around $600 a year, resulting in a net income of $6,000 US a year on a property that cost $8,000 AUD.\n\nMy third and fourth properties were both single-family homes in good areas that cost $14,000 US each and returned a monthly gross rental income of $700 US each. The two properties had a total cost of $28,000 US and grossed around $15,000 US a year. My fifth property was a tax foreclosure that I purchased for $4,000 US. The property was in great condition in a reasonable part of town. I signed a land contract with the previous owner to buy his house back for $30,000 US at 7% interest over 10 years, with payments of around $333 US per month. I offered him the opportunity to act as my property manager in exchange for a percentage of the rents and payment for any work he did on the properties, which he eagerly accepted.\n\nSeven years later, I have transferred the property manager's house back to him with a quit claim deed and sold the remaining properties for $100,000 US. After taxes and commission, I expect to receive around $120,000 AUD, which is quite lucrative for my initial investment of $53,000 AUD. I also received around $30,000 AUD in rent each year. I believe that buying when everyone else is selling and selling when everyone else is buying is a winning strategy, and I am on the lookout for my next positive cash flow investment, possibly in an emerging market impacted by the oil shock.\n\nI wish you all happiness and success in your investments. Take care.\n\nVR"}

{"3507": "You've inquired about getting a loan. Unfortunately, you don't have any collateral to offer in exchange for the loan, and you also lack a stable source of income. While a position not directly related to your field of study may not seem ideal, it will provide you with some financial stability. A job that aligns with your major, even if it's not perfect, can offer valuable experience that may assist you in finding your desired position. The process from applying to a job, to going through the interview process, receiving an offer letter and finally starting employment can take many months, even if you are an ideal candidate. Therefore, it's wise to consider a job with a quicker interview cycle in the interim to obtain a more immediate start date. You may feel qualified for jobs that you perceive as beneath your level of education or expertise, but a role like this was historically meant to provide a platform for individuals transitioning from university to their desired career. While your end goal is still to attain your dream job, you may need to focus on adjusting your expectations. When you had more financial freedom, you could afford to be choosy about the company, location, and salary you preferred. However, in your present situation, it's critical to be more flexible. It is not only a matter of being able to visit potential employers for interviews but also obtaining access to basic necessities like food and health insurance. Consult career counselors on your alma mater's campus to avail their expertise in resume preparation and job search guidance.

{"3508": "\n\nThe stock market typically responds positively to monetary easing, which involves lowered interest rates and easy access to cheap money for companies. This enables them to borrow at a reduced cost and increase profits, resulting in a rise in share prices. As noted by John Benson, Quantitative Easing tends to have a positive impact on stocks. However, the recent downturn in the stock market was partly influenced by concerns about the eventual end of QE and the potential for future interest rate hikes."}
{"3509": "\n\nThe arbitrary nature of units of measure can be exemplified by the difference between a piece of wood that is 25 centimeters long versus one that is 10 inches long. Typically, someone decides on the most convenient unit of measurement for a given quantity, whether it be heat, distance, or money. For instance, imagine that the government releases a new currency with 10 times the value of the old one; consequently, salaries and prices would undergo proportionate transformations. If purchasing a particular car used to cost 2,000 foobars, its price would now be 200 new foobars. Would this affect someone's financial well-being? Generally, if all prices experience identical changes, the shift has no significant impact, apart from causing minor difficulties in converting to a new system. A currency's strength is not necessarily reliant on it being valued higher than other currencies, just as inches are not superior to centimeters on account of the former offering more wood than the latter. Instead, we consider a currency strong when it is stable or increasing relative to other currencies. So, if yesterday it took 10 foobars to buy 1 plugh but today the rate is 9 foobars to 1 plugh, then foobars are deemed stronger, even if people still need more foobars than plughs to obtain the same quantity."}
{"3510": "\n\nIn this instance, it appears that the interest is determined by multiplying the nominal daily interest rate by the number of days in the period. To calculate the total payment, a trial and error approach can be taken with the use of a spreadsheet, due to the varying number of days in each period. However, in cases where the interest charge for each period is the same, a more usual formula can be implemented. The formula is as follows: m=P*r^n*(r-1)/(r^n-1), where P represents the original principle, r represents the growth factor per payment period (i.e. interest rate + 100% divided by 100), and n represents the number of payments. It's important to note that the growth factor pertains to each period, meaning that if monthly payments are being made, the rate should represent the interest per month. The last payment may differ due to rounding errors, unequal numbers of days per period, or other technical factors. Although the aforementioned formula cannot provide the correct answer for this particular example due to the varying periods, it should come relatively close. Here's an example: The interest rate is 0.7% with an average of 28.8 days per period, resulting in a growth factor of 20.16% + 1 = 1.2016. There are 5 payments, and the original principle is 500. After plugging in these values, the total payment would be m=500*1.2016^5*(1.2016-1)/(1.2016^5-1) = 167.78. Although the final answer is off by a degree, it is in the ballpark."}
{"3511": "\n\nI am really impressed with some of the responses shared here. It's important to remember why we invest in the first place. Personally, I prefer investing in Dividend stocks and Dividend Capturing strategy. Here's why - there are over 3,500 companies paying dividends this year, which means I can potentially receive a dividend almost every day. You may ask, what happens if the stock goes down? Well, there's a small subset of these companies that have consistently increased their dividend payout to investors for over 25 years, and an even smaller group that has been raising their payouts every year for over 50 years. These companies have demonstrated a great history of paying out higher dividends to their investors year after year, even when Kennedy was in office, and can serve as a reliable investment for long-term returns.\n\nWith the Dividend Capturing strategy, I can collect 10-20 checks per month with little effort. Also, it's important to note that the stock price is not the only factor that determines the value of a company. Factors such as earnings, the balance sheet, cash flow, and market cap, to name a few in the quarterly report, provide a clearer picture of a company's value. So, if the stock price goes down, we need to look at other factors to determine whether the company is still valuable or not. If the earnings and market keep going up even when the stock price goes down, it means the public perception of the company's value is not accurate."}
{"3512": "\n\nCongratulations on your desire to start your own business. However, it's important to have a realistic outlook. Without a substantial track record of successful investing, it will be difficult to attract potential investors. Starting any type of public investment vehicle requires meeting regulatory requirements, which can be costly. Alternatively, you can be your own hedge fund using your own money. Keep in mind that a hedge fund typically involves contrarian investing. It's unlikely that someone will just give you money to invest, so it's important to show that you're good at it and have a substantial investment of your own in the fund. Chances of success increase if you can show that your hedge fund proposes something unique. It's not easy to do, so it may be helpful to find friends willing to invest and build a successful track record.

{"3514": "\n\nRevised: When making a 401(k) contribution, it is typically Federal tax-free and may also be free from State tax, depending on where you reside, like in California. However, a court case from several years ago demonstrated that some citizens contributed to 401(k) or IRA in New York to avoid paying New York state income tax, moved to Florida (as it has no income tax), and withdrew money. New York sued, but the court ruled in their favour. While one can avoid California state income tax by contributing to a 401(k), moving to a different state like Texas would limit state income tax liability. However, one will face different challenges at the Federal level, as the 401(k) trustee will hold the money. Accessing the money entails paying deferred taxes, which will be treated as income on removal. Early removal before 59 1/2 years will incur a 10% penalty. If not yet retired, the Federal government considers withdrawal before 59 1/2 years a breach of the agreement since the deferred tax finances retirement. One can choose to leave the money in an old employer's 401(k) or roll it over to a new employer's 401(k) or IRA account but introducing investment and currency risks if they have left the US. If someone moves countries, their US residence status depends on their driver's license, mailing address, living quarters, etc. For example, someone from California moving to France remains a California resident and must still pay the income tax while moving from California to Texas then France makes one's US residence Texas.

{"3516": "\n\nIt's frustrating that no one seems to be answering the original question. The question is specifically about whether paying off a 30-year mortgage in 15 years would have the same cost as a 15-year mortgage with the same interest rate. While some people may argue that factors like opportunity cost, flexibility, and family expenses are important to consider, they are subjective and depend on individual circumstances. \n\nIn my opinion, the answer to the original question is yes, but only if you pay off your 30-year mortgage on the exact same schedule as your theoretical 15-year mortgage. However, in reality, the answer is actually no for two reasons: the amortization schedule and the fact that 30-year mortgages typically have higher interest rates than 15-year mortgages. \n\nIn general, mortgage payments are structured so that most of the monthly payment goes toward interest in the first half of the loan's life. While this can be beneficial for tax purposes early on, it means that if you opt to pay off your 30-year mortgage early, you will likely have paid more in interest than you would have with a 15-year mortgage. \n\nWhile some people may choose to pay extra each year to chip away at their principal, this still doesn't negate the fact that 30-year mortgages typically have higher interest rates and that the amortization schedules are different. Additionally, if you have the ability to pay down a significant amount of your principal early on, you may want to consider borrowing less to begin with. \n\nOverall, it's important to consider the long-term financial benefits of a paid off or nearly paid off home. While a 30-year mortgage may offer more flexibility in the short term, a 15-year mortgage is the better option for financial security if it fits within your budget. It's also worth considering that while investing in the stock market may make sense for some people, it's not a guaranteed return, unlike a fixed mortgage payment. \n\nIn summary, while there may not be a straightforward answer to the original question, it's important to consider the specific factors at play and make an informed decision based on your individual circumstances."}
{"3517": "\n\nAre you listed on the title? If so, you may have slightly more negotiating power. However, it is never a good idea to co-sign a loan, even for a relative or friend. Co-signing entails being legally responsible for the loan's repayment if the primary account holder defaults. Even if you make the payments, you are not the vehicle's owner if your name is not on the title. It is important to understand that if you co-sign, you are legally obligated to repay the loan in full. Co-signing does not serve as a character reference, and you will have to pay the loan yourself if the borrower defaults. If you can't pay, the lender can bring a lawsuit against you and garnish your wages or bank accounts. Late payments or defaults will hurt your credit score. Co-signing does not give you any ownership or rights to the vehicle, only the obligation to repay the loan. Removing your name from co-signing can be difficult, but options include convincing the ex-boyfriend and the bank to remove you or seeking legal assistance. Bankruptcy is an option, but it is a severe measure with long-term consequences that should be weighed against the loan's remaining balance."}

Moreover, there is a concern about monetary policy, inflation, and interest rates that are set by the Federal Reserve. Although the government should not keep interest rates low for the sole purpose of saving money, it is theoretically possible. This could lead to inflation, which is unpredictable and disruptive, increasing the overall economic risk. Additionally, it should be noted that if an asset's nominal value increases due to inflation, taxes could still be owed upon the asset's sale, even though its actual value has remained the same."}

Instead, consider whether your risk appetite has changed and adjust your portfolio accordingly. It is worth noting that risk is not always negative, as there are cases where riskier investments can be preferred. For example, if you are hesitant to take risks at the roulette table, you could lower your risk by reducing your bet from $1 to 50 cents. This simple action can shift the payoffs from $2 or 0 to 50 cents or $1.50. In essence, if you find that your level of comfort with risk has changed, you should adjust your exposure accordingly.

On page 28 of the \"Student finance - how you're assessed and paid\" document, it clearly states that those aged 60 or over can only apply for a Maintenance Loan of up to \u00a33,566 based on their income. Furthermore, if the household income exceeds \u00a343,675, no loan is given. This significantly decreases the attractiveness of this route, although it may not be the same for someone relying solely on the \u00a36K state pension. Initially, I compared this route's \"free money\" against the UK's average pension pot of \u00a350K, which is pitiful.

This means that, in effect, you are simply swapping one asset for another. To illustrate this point, consider the analogy of exchanging a $100 bill for five $20 bills.

If it then conducts a secondary public offering for an additional 100, it should generate around 250; otherwise, its value decreases. If the company fails to utilize the extra funds effectively, it will experience a net profit of only 25 from the investment of 200, which is unfavorable.

Your money will be locked up for at least 40 years, and you'll have to navigate many tricky and trap-laden rules just to get money for simple things. For example, you won't be able to leverage the 401K to purchase a house or pay for college tuition. Although you may receive some match, investing in your career at a young age could yield stronger results than just saving money for retirement. If you withdraw your funds early, you'll pay more of a penalty than just the tax rate. I recommend waiting until you're at least 30 years old to begin investing in your 401K. \n\nPersonally, I saved money in a 401K for a few months before I understood the rules. I decided against a 401K and instead saved my money in a bank. After a few years, I had enough money to start my own business, which wasn't possible through the 401K. \n\nFurthermore, if you're in a city like New York, it's important to invest in yourself in the short term. Although living in Manhattan may be more expensive, people who spend more on rent often have more time for themselves and can be more productive at work.

Registered market makers are paid to ensure there is liquidity and have orders within the market to accommodate buyers and sellers.

As a result, there are more cancellations than actual trades, but this doesn't affect the market. Usually, individuals do not need market makers to trade, as there is an abundance of organic liquidity. In the rare event where liquidity dwindles, market makers are available, but they cannot cancel their orders if they want to ensure the market remains stable. It's important to remember most trades don't make it to stock exchanges anymore and are sent to brokers' internal dark pools.

Cloonan's thesis suggests that passive investors could potentially miss out on substantial gains if they are not fully invested in equities. He does warn, however, that investors must be mindful of their withdrawal horizons and apply specific tactics for shifting their portfolio when necessary - particularly if they require the funds in the next five years, as withdrawing during a market low could be detrimental. What struck a chord with me was Cloonan's suggestion to plot a straight line of reasonable return expectations, as this places your focus on your expected return rather than worrying about market highs and lows. It is important to keep a long-term perspective, as experiencing 2-3 bear markets is common. During these difficult times, it is essential to remain steady and not react impulsively, as the market will come back. Cloonan provides further guidance for passive investors to follow this mentality and briefly touches on active strategy. Ultimately, Investing at Level 3 could be the catalyst for investors to rethink traditional methods and consider a different approach to investing - potentially shifting away from the conventional 70/30 split."}

Alternatively, you can choose to not offer a company-wide plan and set up your own personal IRA. Though the contribution limits are lower than an individual 401(k), it's easy to set up and won't cost any fees.\n\nIn short, if you want to avoid plan management fees, the best option for self-employed individuals is an individual 401(k), or an IRA for those with employees."}

You do not need to include this amount in your income tax return, but if you want to be cautious, attach the stub from the reimbursement to a copy of your bank statement showing that you deposited the money into your account and store it in your tax file for the year in case of an IRS audit. The reimbursement amount is a deductible business expense for your employer, and he is required to keep documentation that the reimbursement plan complies with the IRS regulations. Therefore, your employer needs the store receipt, not a hand-written note from you, to show the IRS if requested.

For instance, if the non-profit was invoiced $2000 for the carport, and the business donated the same amount back to the non-profit after receiving the payment, then the tax deduction would be $3000 ($1000 cost plus $2000 donation). However, this would result in $2000 in income, and ultimately generate a $1000 loss, which is the same as the expenses incurred. It is advisable to have an explanation for providing the service free of charge, as it might raise questions. If personal benefit was derived from the donation, it could result in an income tax liability, similar to purchasing a TV for personal use using business funds.

The planner will conduct a thorough analysis of your short and long-term plans, risk tolerance, and level of involvement in managing your portfolio before devising an initial plan. This plan will be tested against stock market simulations to evaluate its risk, growth potential, and volatility. The planner will work to optimize the plan to ensure that normal volatility falls within your comfort zone while seeking the best return with minimal risk. While the plan may not be perfect, it provides a good starting point until you gain more knowledge about investing. It offers more personalized advice than that of a general guide, as people have different goals, financial statuses, and time horizons. \n\nRegarding purchasing a house, one should never consider it an investment that brings financial gains.

While this may not be practical for comparing stocks like AAPL vs. GOOG, it could make more sense when tracking an index. In fact, some \"natural\" price points, such as dividing by 100, are used by certain S&P funds. Nonetheless, there are a couple of reasons why two different funds might price their shares differently even when tracking the same underlying index.\n\nOne reason is demand; if many investors want to purchase shares, more may be issued at a lower price. Moreover, pricing shares at a higher price may decrease demand as it makes it harder to buy round lots. This is important for standardized options as they always act on lots. Additionally, higher prices may make it harder to buy in for a specific amount since each unit share has a greater chance of being further away from the target amount. Conversely, shares priced too low will also find fewer buyers because some investors have minimum price requirements due to low-priced, speculative and volatile penny stocks. Thus, different funds may pick various price points to cater to demand that is not being filled by other funds selling at different price points."}

To determine affordability, I suggest that a \"cheap\" home should cost no more than 20% of your income, \"affordable\" homes should be between 20-30%, and \"not affordable\" homes should be over 30%.\n\nWhen comparing the costs of renting versus buying, there are additional factors to consider. Renting is typically a straightforward transaction with lower risks and liability. However, it does not provide the opportunity to recoup any value from the cash spent on housing. On the other hand, purchasing a home can be more complex with the added benefit of building equity and making money through appreciation. However, it also requires careful attention to expenses and circumstances that could impact the value of the investment. For example, high property taxes in certain areas could pose a significant threat to future sales prices. Similarly, poorly-run HOAs or condo associations could lead to unexpected and expensive fees.\n\nUltimately, it is important to consider your personal tastes and financial situation before making a decision on housing.

You must also use ADS for any property that has been imported from a foreign country that is subject to an Executive Order due to the country's trade restrictions or discriminatory acts (refer to Publication 946 for further information). \n\nIf none of the above circumstances apply to your property, you have the option to elect ADS. However, you should only choose it if it benefits you to depreciate your property over a longer period. Generally, the shorter the depreciation period, the more you can deduct or accumulate in passive losses each year, which is usually preferable. However, if you plan on selling your property in ten years or more, you should consider the depreciation recapture and determine if the passive losses are worth the additional tax implications in that particular case."}
{"3579": "\n\nI need to revise my original answer as it contained a significant mistake. It is not always possible for an exchange to create its own product to track any underlying index. In cases where the underlying index, such as the S&P indices, Russell indices, Dow Jones indices, etc., are copyrighted, the exchange must enter into a licensing agreement with the copyright holder to use the index's formula and name. Without such a license, the exchange would only be able to approximate the underlying index, making such a product difficult to market. However, the CME does offer several futures and other derivatives whose value is based on some multiple of the S&P500's value on the date when the product expires. When actively traded, such a product can serve as a reasonable indicator of the market's expectation of the S&P500's future value. For those interested in tracking the S&P500, it is worth looking into the front month of the CME's S&P 500 Mini future, which trades from 17:00-16:00 Chicago time, Sunday night through Friday afternoon. However, it is important to remember that the prices quoted are subject to change. Another example is the Russell 2000 index, which until 2017 was licensed exclusively by the ICE Exchange. This product traded from 20:00-17:30 New York time, Sunday night through Friday afternoon. However, in mid-2017, the CME purchased the license, making it the new exchange to track the product. In conclusion, there is usually a product out there tracking the index you need, but it may require further research to find and may not be useful for your specific needs."}

{"3584": "\n\nIt cannot be emphasized enough: Do not base your financial planning on your credit score. Don't even consider it. Instead, create a budget and adhere to it, taking into account both short and long-term savings. Ensure that you pay your bills on time and use credit responsibly. By doing all of these things, your credit rating will naturally take care of itself. Do not attempt to boost it artificially by planning your finances around it. When it comes to 0% financing, my personal guideline is to only use it if I have the money to purchase the item outright, and even then, only if repayment on the loan will not jeopardize my budget. Other people have different rules, including avoiding these loans altogether, so you should create a rule that aligns with your own financial goals. The one thing you should avoid is optimizing your credit score because it should not be the basis for your financial decisions. What matters most is making sure you do not allow the teaser rate to influence you into making purchases that you would not otherwise make. Remember that you are not receiving free money; you are just extending the repayment duration, which is limited. Always read the credit agreement's fine print, as it may be saturated with hidden fees and traps. In some cases, if you do not clear the balance before the introductory period ends, your interest charges could be backdated to the date of the purchase. Therefore, you must be well-versed in your terms and conditions. Since you appear to be starting your financial journey, may the force be with you, and keep in mind that patience may be your most valuable asset in your personal finance toolbox. Lastly, avoid planning your finances around your credit score."}

Open-ended mutual funds are not traded on stock exchanges, so the market doesn't determine the share price as it does for company shares.

The NAV is the net worth of all the shares held by the fund plus cash on hand, divided by the number of mutual fund shares outstanding. The NAV may increase or decrease, depending on distribution. If you reinvest your distribution, your total investment value will remain the same, but your shares' basis will increase, resulting in owing less tax when sold. However, the income received from the distribution is taxable, and you'll still have to pay tax on it.

However, it's worth noting that the question doesn't mention the coupon rate, i.e., the regular payments the bondholder receives each year. To calculate the coupon rate, let's consider the cash flow described. Initially, you pay $1015 at the start of Year #1 to buy the bond. From Year #1 to Year #5, you receive an unknown coupon payment, X. At the end of Year #5, you receive the face value of the bond, $1000. The payout equals the money received, using a time value of money of 4.69%. If we use the date of maturity of the bond as the valuation date, we have the following equation:\n\nMaturity + Future Value of Coupons = Future Value of Bond Purchase Price\n$1000 + X * ((1 + 0.0469)^5-1)/0.0469 = $1015 * 1.0469^5\n\nSolving for X, we obtain $50.33, which represents the coupon rate of 5.033%. Thus, you will receive $50.33 at the end of each of the five years. \n\nNow, we can apply the new yield rate to calculate the price paid for the bond, Y. Using the same formula above, the unknown in the equation is Y. \n\n$1000 + $50.33 * ((1 + 0.0487)^5 - 1) / 0.0487 = Y * 1.0487^5\n\nSolving this equation for Y, we obtain $1007.08."}
{"3591": "\n\nIn 2014, the IRS released Notice 2014-21, providing guidance on the tax treatment of virtual currency. According to the notice, virtual currency is treated as property for federal tax purposes, and general tax principles for property transactions apply to virtual currency transactions. Any capital gains from the sale of virtual currency are subject to taxation, which is calculated as the proceeds from the sale minus the basis (the initial cost of the property). Until the sale of virtual currency, it does not require any reporting.\n\nFor those who acquire virtual currency through mining, Q-8 of the notice applies. This section states that the fair market value of the virtual currency on the date of receipt as a result of mining is included in gross income. Therefore, the market value of the virtual currency generated by mining is considered as the initial basis.\n\nWhen trading in multiple cryptocurrencies, each transaction may count as a sale of one asset and the purchase of another. Therefore, you may need to report each exchange as a sale with the asset's initial basis and the fair market value at the time of the transaction. If the exchange rules do not apply, you will need to calculate a $0 basis for the initial asset and report the fair market value as the basis for the new asset.\n\nIt is essential to document each holding's eligibility for long-term capital gains treatment (owned for more than a year) and to seek professional help when dealing with a considerable amount of money. You may also contact the IRS directly or Keith A. Aqui of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (Income Tax and Accounting) for more information."}

It is important to note that the relocation company typically works for a potential employer and aims to make the transition easy for the homeowner, who is likely being hired for a professional position such as a manager, engineer, or accountant. By guaranteeing the sale, the relocation company can easily arrange for new financing and may bridge the gap by securing the initial financing and downpayment. This does not necessarily mean there is an issue with the house being purchased, as the relocation company's primary concern is ensuring a smooth transition for the homeowner. However, a failed sale could compromise the employment change, making a no contingencies sale more appealing. While some buyers may agree to no contingencies sales to get better prices or repairs, it is reasonable to not proceed with the provision if it makes one uncomfortable. If one decides to move forward, it is important to have a real estate lawyer draft the agreement and demand disclosure of any previous failed sales and their reasons.

Next, consider whether you'd pay that amount for a similar functioning car with no issues. If yes, then fixing your car is the logical choice, despite the high cost. However, if your answer is no, purchasing a used car could be more cost-effective, provided that a mechanic inspects the vehicle beforehand. This can spare you from losing significant value, known as the \"property-line tax,\" which occurs when a new car is driven out of the dealership. Nearly-new cars have a similar lifespan to brand new ones, but at lower prices. In personal experience, buying a brand-new car can be viable if you get a discounted price, but researching the cost of repairing it entirely is also worth considering.

Many traders only come to realize the significance of commissions during a market crash, which is why it is better to make small mistakes and learn lessons when the price is low (e.g., -10% of your portfolio) rather than pay a high price (e.g., -30..50%). Here's a tip: Some smaller exchanges do not charge a commission for operations; rather, they only take the market spread as payment (usually only $0.01).

Because most global currencies are free-floating fiat currencies, it's essential to have silver, gold, platinum, or another easily storable, protective, and transportable asset to protect against government currency devaluations. The value of the metal remains consistent regardless of fluctuations in the currency in which it's measured (such as the Euro, in your case).\n\nThe ECB has been cautious about extensively printing currency, therefore the need to safeguard against plummeting currency exchange rates is less urgent, and the proportion of precious metals in your diversification strategy should take that into account. However, if you live in countries like Argentina, it's crucial to hold a more substantial portion of your assets in precious metals. \n\nThe EU contains multiple issues, and the lack of fluid currency and capital, coupled with many governments' overspending, dilutes the value preservation aspect of holding precious metals. When you anticipate government sovereign currency devaluations, in instances such as hot capital flows out of your country or printing, you should diversify extensively into precious metals.\n\nThe Eurozone is not an emerging market, and presently, the trend is that capital is flowing back into developed economies; therefore, it would be prudent to reduce your percentage of precious metals in your portfolio. In spite of that, as an American, I possess silver and gold in my retirement portfolio, but it doesn't make up a substantial proportion of my investment.\n\nIf the US government fails to manage the next budget crisis and forces the Federal Reserve to print money, I'll trade out of my soft assets and move my investment into precious metals. To diversify, you can consider investing in ETFs, indexes, dividend-paying stocks, or bonds. Still, you need to scrutinize all the fine print, particularly with precious metal ETFs, to avoid getting duped.\n\nOnce you determine your diversification percentages, adjust them based on macro-economic trends to avoid pitfalls.

Consequently, their options are exchanged dollar-for-dollar for HugeFirm stock at $250 per share, resulting in them receiving only four shares for every one. I have heard of this occurring frequently during the 1999-2000 boom and bust period. The issue was that historically, only CEOs and CFOs earning salaries of $20 million or more had access to this type of stock option and could obtain expert legal and financial counsel to navigate its potential pitfalls. However, during the dot-com boom, companies began offering it to rank-and-file tech employees earning salaries of $50,000 who lacked even a basic understanding of financial concepts such as 401Ks and Roth accounts. This resulted in a financial disaster for many individuals who were unable to comprehend the complexities or take any corrective action as they were not executive decision-makers. Even the companies that granted these stock options did not anticipate this outcome. The aftermath resulted in significant problems for everyone, including the IRS, which struggled to justify collecting taxes on phantom income that those tech employees would never realistically earn. The situation became so untenable that laws and practices had to be altered to remedy it. Consequently, this problem is no longer as prevalent as it once was."}
{"3619": "\n\nThere are various reasons as to why institutional investors hold a significant amount of a company's stock. One reason can be attributed to the company's inclusion in an index, particularly a major one. Numerous asset management firms have index-tracking funds or closely follow a benchmark, and such stocks would typically be heavily held by institutional investors. However, being part of an equity index depends on market capitalization and not on intrinsic quality or stock returns. Another reason is that the company may be viewed as a good prospect for growth or value, particularly in a sector that attracts institutional investors. Investing in popular assets, as opposed to undervalued ones, is part of the norm in the industry. While algorithmic trading decisions made based on technicals can also lead to institutional investors holding a stock. Sometimes, companies may sell a substantial share of their stock as part of an IPO or for additional capital raising, with institutional investors buying in as a result. Nevertheless, this doesn't necessarily signify the stock's potential as an excellent investment, and a high institutional ownership percentage may not imply less risk. For instance, during the 2008 crisis, Bear Stearns had a high institutional ownership percentage, yet the investment proved unprofitable."}

The first factor is based on quantitative data such as supply and demand, earnings per share, book value, and debt ratio. By using various formulas, one can estimate what the stock price should be. However, this method assumes that the market is rational, which is not always the case. The second factor is emotional and can lead to unpredictable changes in the stock price; for instance, Apple's price fluctuations after their earning reports. The company's metrics were positive, yet the stock price decreased, driven by unmet expectations. Sometimes, market reactions to people's emotional reactions makes it difficult to predict the stock price accurately. Moreover, the wide range of available strike prices in the options market indicate that predicting stock price with precision is a challenging task."}

Another option would be to sell the vehicle or something else to cover the remaining amount owed.

Anything that happens within this timeframe is considered speculation or gambling, rather than a true investment. This rule often applies to inexperienced amateurs trying to compete with more seasoned professionals in the financial industry.\n\nHowever, despite the risks involved, many people have successfully made significant amounts of money through investing in stocks and other financial products. Though there may be some who give biased advice or recommendations solely for their own financial gain, the principle of investing in the stock market is sound - it is based on a company's ability to generate value and pay dividends.\n\nThere are several reasons why investing in stocks or other financial markets can be a wise choice. Firstly, it provides potentially higher returns than other investment options, such as putting money in an interest-bearing bank account. Secondly, it offers a chance to diversify one's portfolio and mitigate risk. Thirdly, historically speaking, the stock market typically trends upwards over long periods of time, providing an opportunity for substantial gains.\n\nOverall, while there are certainly risks involved in investing, the potential rewards can be substantial for those who are willing to do their due diligence and make informed decisions about their financial future."}

Personally, I am managing a very low interest rate of less than 3% and diligently working to pay off my mortgage. However, one night, I found myself pondering the prospect of reducing my payments and securing additional funds to purchase another rental property. In an effort to gain some guidance, I picked up Kevin O'Leary's book, Cold Hard Truth On Men, Women, and Money: 50 Common Money Mistakes and How to Fix Them, which I happened to be reading at the time.\n\nImmediately, the first line of the book grabbed my attention: \"The best investment anyone can make is to pay off their mortgage early.\" The author then offered calculations assuming a 3% mortgage payment. In light of Mr. O'Leary's personal and professional accomplishments, I felt his advice carried significant weight. Moreover, Mark Cuban shares a comparable philosophy on debt reduction. Apparently, 70% of the Forbes richest individuals would encourage debt elimination as a pivotal step in wealth creation.\n\nConsidering this advice, I have established a plan to adhere to Mr. O'Leary's suggestion and pay off my mortgage over the next 33 weeks (by September 2016) before weighing any future financial decisions."}

{"3629": "\n\nWhat steps should I take to minimize my future debt? The best way to achieve this is to reduce your expenses. The first step towards financial independence is to learn to live with less. If I receive $3500, should I use it to pay off my credit cards or keep it as cash? This decision will depend on the interest rates associated with both the $3500 and credit cards. If the interest rate on the $3500 is higher than the credit card interest, it's best not to use any of it for the credit cards. It's the interest rate that hurts you in the long run, not the money you've borrowed. However, if the interest rate on the $3500 is lower than your credit cards, consider using some of it to pay off your credit cards. If you could be without work for a long time, it's wise to hold onto all the funds. Regarding savings, it may seem unconventional, but I don't recommend saving several months' worth of funds. Many employers offer retirement savings accounts like 401(k) and Thrift Savings Plans with matching contributions, which is a better approach. The rate of return on savings accounts is low, so they are not wise for long-term savings. I invested in a Thrift Savings Plan instead of a savings account and saved $12,000. Long-term investment accounts allow you to withdraw funds in case of emergency, such as unemployment. Plus, I find it too tempting to keep large sums of money on hand."}

However, the alternative minimum tax (AMT) may apply when calculating taxes owed on ISOs. Should the AMT apply, the treatment of your ISOs shifts to that of non-qualifying options. If exercise occurs earlier, a countdown clock begins to tick, as holding the underlying stock for at least two years after being granted the options and at least one year after exercising them constitutes a caveat for ISO classification."}

{"3641": "The loan's structure and reporting determine its impact on credit. If the loan company reports to a credit bureau on behalf of both borrower and cosigner, both individuals receive a new account on their credit report. While this may initially decrease credit scores, it can have a positive long-term effect. Failure to pay will negatively affect both parties' credit. Alternatively, the loan company may report to a credit agency on only one individual, leaving the other as a backup. If the loan isn't reported, it won't impact credit unless it goes into collections. It's important to note that a loan's impact on credit only applies to the bureau it's reported to.

{"3643": "\n\nAlthough I didn't doubt everyone's assumption, I wanted to see the math, so I tinkered around with some spreadsheets. My initial assumption was monthly payments for 30 years, which came out to a total of $483.89. I then tested two scenarios where we would pay an extra $200 per month on top of this amount. In one scenario, we paid the extra money directly to the lender. In the second scenario, we set aside the additional $200 every month until we could pay off a $10,000 loan with a 7% interest rate. I assumed that the minimum payments were allocated proportionally and overpayments were divided equally, which meant it took us 77 months to pay off loan 5, 88 months to pay off loan 4, 120 months to pay off loan 3, 165 months to pay off loan 2, and 170 months to pay off loan 1.\n\nMoving onto scenario 2, where we pay $483.89 to the lender each month and save $200 separately. By month 48, we had saved $9,600, which was almost equal to the principle remaining in loan 3 of $9,547. After paying off loan 3, we were left with loans 1, 2, 4, and 5, which had a total principle of around $60,930. We then began making payments of $683.89 towards the remaining loans, and our weighted average interest rate decreased to 6.8% from 6.824%. Using this information, we can calculate that it would take us around 124.4 months to pay off the remaining loans, for a grand total of 172.4 months.\n\nIn conclusion, scenario 1 pays off the debt three months earlier with the same total monthly expenditure as scenario 2."}

{"3652": "\n\nThe question is not specific regarding the timing of the initial investment \u2013 whether it occurs now or in one period from now. If the investment occurs now, then it is a perpetuity due. I will consider two scenarios, A and B, pertaining to the size of the initial investment.\n\nA. Assuming that the initial investment (C_0) is made now and each subsequent payment has a relationship of (1+g) with this investment, the relevant base equation is for the present value of a growing perpetuity due, expressed in terms of C_0, i.e., PVGPD = [C_0*(1+g)*(1+i)]/(i-g). To meet the requirements of the question, i=fixed rate of return (f) and g=expected inflation rate (e), allowing us to rewrite the equation as PVGPD = [C_0*(1+e)*(1+i)]/(i-e]. We know that f is a fixed nominal rate that must be adjusted for e to calculate the real rate (r) using the formula f=(1+r)*(1+e)-1. Thus, PVGPD = [C_0*(1+e)*(1+(1+r)(1+e)-1)]/((1+r)*(1+e)-1-e]. Simplifying this, we get PVGPD = {C_0*(1+r)(1+e)^2}/[r(1+e)], which can also be written as PVGPD = [C_0*(1+r)*(1+e)]/r.\n\nB. If the initial investment (X) is not equal to each subsequent perpetual payment (C_1), then the relevant base equation is for the initial investment plus the present value of a growing perpetuity, i.e., PVGP = X + [C_1/(i-g)]. Rewriting this, we can substitute f and e to get PVGP = X + [C_1/(f-e)], which can then be substituted into the previous equation for PVGPD to get PVGPD = X + C_1/[r*(1+e)]."}

Assuming a 3% inflation rate, your starting $10,000 would be worth $10,300 in 2015. To measure your progress, divide the difference between what you have now ($9,000) and the adjusted value of your starting funds ($10,300) by your starting amount ($9,000), which gives you 14.44%. Any return exceeding 14.44% is good. Because living costs and inflation rates can vary by location, be sure to adjust your calculations accordingly. Cheers."}

This value is set by the finance company and is based on an estimate of how much the car will be worth at the end of the agreement. If the car is worth less than this agreed value, you can simply hand it back without incurring any additional costs. If it is worth more, you may be able to profit if you pay for the car or roll over into a new agreement. Therefore, the finance company has an incentive to set a sensible value to avoid losing money.\n\nHowever, if the value of the car has declined significantly since the start of the agreement, the finance company may have underestimated its worth and could incur a loss when you return the car at the end of the agreement. Additionally, you may have the legal right to voluntary termination once you have paid off half of the Total Amount Payable, which should be outlined in the agreement. If you wish to terminate the agreement before this point, negotiation with the finance company may be necessary. \n\nIt is important to note that while this answer is based on research, the specifics of PCP agreements may vary, and individuals should thoroughly read and understand their contracts before entering into any agreement."}

However, employees must substantiate their business expenses beyond the amount reimbursed (e.g. providing evidence of the business purpose of travel or the number of business miles driven), following the methods outlined in Pub. 463.

However, it would be beneficial to utilize free mortgage calculators, which are widely available on the internet, to calculate and assess the actual numbers before reaching a conclusion. It is important to keep in mind that most renovations do not result in increased sales prices. This happens because potential buyers may not fancy the changes made in the house but would have been happy if they had the chance to renovate the house themselves. If renovating does not negatively affect the ability to sell the house, it is best to renovate when planning to stay for an extended period and enjoy the enhanced features.

Essentially, if you use the car exclusively for business purposes (i.e. not for personal errands), you can deduct the full cost and expenses. If you use the car for both business and personal use, you can only deduct the portion that was used for business purposes. To calculate this, you can either keep precise records of the car's expenses and usage, or use the standard mileage rate (which changes annually). Note that simply paying for the car from a business account does not automatically make it a deductible expense. Finally, please be advised that the IRS pays close attention to deductions related to cars, computers, and home offices, so it's not advisable to try to stretch the rules in these areas."}

{"3677": "\n\nThe price of shares is determined by demand. Assuming an equal number of shares are available for trade, stocks with a higher demand will have a higher price. For example, if a company needs to raise $100, and they have 1000 total shares, they may sell 100 shares for $1 each. If demand exists for at least $1 per share, they can reach their goal; however, if the market value of their shares is only 50 cents apiece, they would only raise $50. In this case, the company could sell another 100 shares. However, as a result of selling more shares, the company's equity ownership decreases. In the first case, the company would own 90% of the equity (900 shares) and in the second case, they would own only 80% of the equity (800 shares).\n\nThe benefit to the company and shareholders of having a higher share price is that the value of the shares increases. Therefore, the company can sell fewer shares and still raise the same amount of money. Many startups offer shares to employees as part of their remuneration package because cash flow is typically tight when starting a new business. Having a higher share price can also act as a credit score, as a more credit-worthy company will typically have a higher share price, making it easier to obtain credit. Additionally, a higher share price can make it more expensive for competitors to take over a company, offering defensive and offensive advantages. All of these advantages are subject to the condition of \"ceteris paribus,\" or \"all other things being equal.\""}
{"3678": "\n\nDifferentiating speculation from investing is significant. Purchasing something with the intention of gaining profit through market fluctuations is speculation.

However, over a year, Person B will gain profit from the economic value the company generates throughout the year, while Person A can only obtain profit when there is a change in the market. Economic value over the span of an hour is negligible. Consequently, Person B is exposed to the risk of purchasing stock, but this is outweighed by the benefit of holding onto the stock for a year. On the other hand, Person A only faces the risk. Furthermore, if Person A buys a new stock every hour, they will have to handle numerous transactions. As a result, despite Person B assuming the same level of risk upon purchasing the stock, Person A bears the greater total risk owing to the frequency of their transactions."}

{"3682": "\n\nI believe that there are actually two agreements between you and your sister, and it would be best to explicitly separate them to bring more clarity. The first agreement pertains to ownership and responsibility for the building, while the second pertains to each of your personal use of a unit. To begin, approach ownership as if you are not living in the building. Divide the down payment, monthly mortgage, taxes and insurance, cost of maintenance, and ownership and benefits of the building in a 70%/30% split, and put these terms in a written contract. Treat this agreement as a business contract. \n\nNext, lease the units to yourselves as if you were tenants, with individual leases for each sister. Each tenant should pay the going rate for the unit they occupy. This provides clarity on each sister's responsibilities in a tenant capacity. If the rent from all three units covers the monthly expenses, then no further action is needed. If the rent exceeds monthly expenses, then each sister will receive business income based on the 70%/30% split. If the rent is less than the monthly expenses, each sister will be required to make up the difference according to the same split rate. If any utilities are included, they should be apportioned via rent based on each unit's usage. \n\nIt is possible to handle all of these transactions via ledger entries, without physically moving the money around, but I believe that it will be more beneficial to explicitly pay rent initially to clarify your dual relationship as joint owners and tenants. \n\nIt is important to acknowledge that this is a potentially sticky situation. Many familial relationships have been strained or ruined by mixing business and renting to family members. You are doing both, so it is important to be careful.

{"3684": "\n\nUpon receiving clarification in comments, I would like to change my answer. It seems that some of the securities mentioned, such as GEAPP, are traded on what is known as the Grey Market. The Grey Market, also referred to as the Gray Market, is a category of OTC stocks that is distinct from Pink Sheets and the OTCBB. According to Investopedia, it is an over-the-counter market where dealers can fulfill orders for preferred customers and aid in a new issue before it is officially released. This enables underwriters and the issuer to establish demand and price securities accordingly before the IPO.\n\nFurther research shows that Grey Sheet stocks are clearly distinct from other financial markets because there are no recent bid or ask quotes available. This is due to the fact that no market makers share data or provide quotes on such securities. There is also no quoting system available to record and settle trades. All Grey Sheet trading is monitored by a broker and conducted between consenting individuals who agree on a price. The only publicly available documentation on trades is when the last trade occurred. Unlike Pink Sheets, Grey Sheet stocks have no SEC registration, possess no stock symbol, and have no shares that can be traded publicly. As a result, such penny stocks are not required to file SEC financial and business reports. Grey Sheet stocks may not be advertised or solicited to the public unless a specific number of shares are qualified to be traded publicly under 504 of Regulation D. Furthermore, Grey Sheet trading is rare, and these securities are considered extremely illiquid due to their low market cap and lack of information.\n\nGrey Sheets are typically associated with IPO, start-up, or spin-off companies, although not all of them are. Grey Sheets are also home to delisted stocks from other markets, including the NASDAQ, OTCBB, and Pink Sheets. Such securities were delisted or removed due to financial issues that prevented them from meeting the minimum requirements of registered SEC filings or stock exchange regulations.\n\nTo answer your question, the cause of the erratic fluctuations is likely due to the illiquidity and lack of information available on Grey Sheet stocks. As a result, most investors tend to be skeptical of these securities and avoid them altogether. Thanks for posing such a great question, by the way."}

For this particular case, we can use the moment of the initial $225,000 loan as a convenient reference point. At this time, you receive this amount and subsequently make 30 payments on the 40% mortgage. To determine the value of these payments, you must calculate the monthly amount required to pay off a $90,000 mortgage over 30 monthly payments at a rate of 0.5% per month. \n\nOnce you have determined this value, you then make 30 payments of an amount X, beginning one month after the 40% mortgage has been repaid.

The vertical axis employs a linear scale, which means that each unit is represented by the same amount of space.

For instance, if you purchase something for $10 and its price changes by $1, that represents a significant shift of 10%. However, if you buy something for $1000 and its price changes by $1, it is minor - only 0.1%.

When buying options, your downside risk is limited to the premium paid. For example, with a $115 contract, your maximum loss would be $19.3, and with a $130 contract, your maximum loss would be $9.3. The reason for this is that the likelihood of AAPL reaching $130 is lower than AAPL hitting $115, and therefore the option writer offers lower probability contracts at a lower price. Ultimately, the strike price is just a target for the stock or index to reach, and you only pay the premium. As the strike price increases (or decreases in the case of a put option), the premium generally decreases. It is advisable to read up further on pricing from this source."}

{"3705": "\n\nAlthough I'm late to mention it, adding a defined risk trade can further improve your cost basis. If you're looking to test the waters with less risk capital, this method could be worth considering. Another option is to purchase inexpensive OTM butterflies or finance further OTM options using the basis reduction from the debit spread. This approach lets you take greater risks, allowing you to engage in 15-20 delta positions. Typically, I opt for debit spreads, buying ATM and selling a few OTM or liquid strikes. However, if you're dealing with a high flier, the outcome could be a disappointment, but it's still a sound trade. If you're someone who prefers a contrarian approach to purchasing calls and puts, this method will lower your risk and allow for a calculated wager."}
{"3706": "\n\nHere's my revised version:\n\n\"What do you want to do?\" would be my response. Personally, I believe any amount you're comfortable with is acceptable, even if it's as low as $100. When considering the specifics of investing, paying a $5 commission for a $100 investment may seem unreasonable. However, in the big picture, what's it matter if you're \"wasting\" $5 on a commission? Your friends likely waste more than that multiple times throughout the day, such as with a morning latte. If investing another $5 empowers you, just as a latte empowers them, then go for it. The studies show that the most important aspect of building a significant investment portfolio is actually doing it. The rate of return and cost associated with investing pales in comparison to actually taking the steps to do it. Additionally, how many of your peers are doing something similar? You're probably in rare company, so if it makes you happy, then it's a wonderful way to spend your money."}
{"3707": "\n\nYou are disregarding the fact that the share price is not solely determined by the supply and demand from investors. The company has the power to buy and sell its own shares, which can also affect the share price. If company X is consistently profitable but does not pay dividends, then option 2 is unlikely to be a viable choice, making option 1 the more plausible outcome unless some bizarre event occurs. This situation is related to the commonly known 'dividend paradox', which I have previously elaborated on in a different answer."}
{"3708": "\n\n\nAs user14469 mentioned, you must decide what type of properties you want to invest in. Are you looking for negatively-geared properties that may have higher long-term growth potential, which are typically located within 15 to 20km from major cities? Or do you prefer positive cash-flow properties that may have lower long-term growth potential, usually located more than 20km from major cities? \n\nWith negatively-geared properties, your rental income won't cover the mortgage and other costs, so you'll have to supplement it with your income. The theory behind this approach is that you can claim a tax deduction on your employment income from negative gearing (which benefits those on higher tax brackets), and the potential long-term growth of the property will make up for the negative gearing over the long term. If you prefer this type of investment, Michael Yardney has some books on the subject. \n\nOn the other hand, positive cash-flow properties generate enough rental income to cover the mortgage and other costs, putting cash into your pockets every week. Although they don't have as much growth potential as inner city properties, they can still provide decent long-term growth if you stick to outer regions of major cities rather than rural towns. If you prefer this type of investment, Margaret Lomas has some books on the subject. \n\nPersonally, I prefer cash-flow positive properties in some of the areas mentioned by user14469, such as Penrith and the surrounding areas. However, with negatively-geared properties, you have to supplement the property with your income and wait for the property price to increase to build up equity. This then allows you to refinance the additional equity and use it as a deposit to buy other properties or supplement your income. The problem is that if you go through a period of low, stagnant, or negative growth, you may have to wait several years for your equity to increase substantially. \n\nWith positively-geared properties, you receive a net income from the property every week, so you don't need to supplement it with your income. This allows you to buy more properties sooner, even during a period of low, stagnant, or negative growth, as you're still getting extra income each week. Over the long term, you benefit from both passive income and capital gains. \n\nUser14469 also recommends researching the area/s you're interested in buying in for at least six months. Visit open homes, attend auctions, talk to real estate agents, and get to know the area. This kind of research beats any information you get from websites, books, or magazines. You'll know what a property is worth and how much you can offer below asking price when one comes onto the market. \n\nAnother consideration is when to buy. Many people in Australia are buying now due to record low interest rates (below 5%). This is causing higher demand in the property markets, and prices are rising steadily. However, many buyers might find it hard to afford the property when interest rates rise to 7% or 8%. I personally prefer to buy when interest rates are rising and near their highs. During this time, no one wants to invest in property, but property owners who bought when interest rates were lower may find it hard to keep making repayments and put their properties on the market. This increases supply, causing prices to fall, making it easier to find bargains and negotiate lower prices. Because interest rates will be near or at their highs, the economy will start to slow down, so it won't be long before interest rates begin dropping again. If you can afford to buy a property at 8%, you'll definitely be able to afford it at 6% or lower. Plus, you would have bought near the lows of the price cycle, just before prices start increasing again as interest rates drop. \n\nIn summary, read and learn from others, but make up your own mind on the type of properties and areas you prefer. Choose carefully, considering the type of income you want to generate and long-term growth potential, and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions."}

{"3727": "\n\nRevised: A house that sells for $200,000 can vary in its monthly rent prices. A 3% rent fee would equal $6,000 annually or $500 per month, which is quite low and may make renting a more favorable choice over buying. However, a 9% rent fee equates to $1,500 monthly and makes purchasing the house to live in or rent out a better choice. In this case, \"paying rent\" should be avoided. It's important to note that the author's view is being conveyed here and not advocated by the writer. The author's quote suggests that an annual rent/purchase price ratio of 3% means that buying should be avoided due to high prices, while a ratio of 6% is borderline and 9% indicates reasonable prices for buying. \n\nChuck's comment is also addressed by discussing how mortgage rates for qualified applicants are generally tight, with an average of 4.4% for the 30-year and 3.45% for 15-year mortgages. However, factors such as location will determine the rent and purchase price that one may have to pay. The article provides an example of how the ratio of home price to the annual rent can differ depending on the area, and also mentions that the decision to buy versus rent is a personal one. The author's approach is debatable as it suggests low rates indicate that the price of the house is too high, whereas the US has already had a housing market crash, and low rates can be favorable for buyers.

However, one way to achieve a high ROE is when the shareholder's equity is small, which could result from past losses eroding the company's capital. When the equity depreciates, the income in a given period might exceed it, resulting in ROE over 100%. In contrast, operating margin is not closely associated with ROE.

For instance, assuming the monthly fair rental value is 0.5% of the purchase value, the borrower would pay 0.4% to the bank monthly. The borrower may choose to pay more than this minimum amount or make a lump sum payment, thereby increasing their stake in the property and reducing future monthly payments.\n\nUpon selling the property, the sale price is distributed between the borrower and the bank based on their ownership percentage at the time of sale.

It is important to consider whether the loan will significantly impact your credit score or just broaden your accounts. Applying for the car loan will cause a brief decrease in your score due to a hard inquiry, but the overall impact is difficult to predict. However, minor fluctuations in your score will likely not affect your interest rate. Additionally, your credit score can vary by as much as 30 points across different lenders and changes daily. \n\nAcquiring a car loan, assuming it is still active during your home buying process, will not greatly affect your ability to afford a mortgage. Banks mainly consider two factors in assessing monthly payments: the amount of your mortgage including insurance, taxes, interest, and any other debts such as credit card or school loan payments. The PITI number should be between 28% to 33% of your monthly income, and other payments should not exceed 10%. If the car loan payments don't exceed the 10% threshold, your mortgage affordability will remain unchanged. If the car loan payments exceed this limit, the bank will require a smaller percentage of your income to go towards PITI. Buying a car before applying for a mortgage can delay the loan process, as it affects the numbers used to evaluate your financial situation.\n\nThe most crucial factor in obtaining a loan is the down payment. Even if you pay cash for the car, highly consider holding onto savings to attain a down payment of 20%. Do not deplete your savings just to reach a 50% down payment level. Keep funds for closing costs, moving expenses, furniture, and emergency situations.

A more realistic option is to cut back on small expenses like coffee, cigarettes, and partying, and save $100 each week. This will enable the person to accumulate enough money to use as a deposit on an asset that appreciates over time. Property is a good choice for investment, but one must take out a loan and establish an interest-only repayment scheme with an offset account to reinvest distributions from shares or rental income. This strategy will help accumulate cash that offsets the loan until the asset is worth more than the loan, and equity can be liberated. Following this approach, one can use the equity to pay off other loans and amass a growing portfolio of property assets that provide ample passive income for retirement. The key lesson is that debt is a valuable tool when used wisely to purchase appreciating assets, and time is essential to research investments and avoid rash decisions."}

A couple with children, regardless of whether they are married, may involve the courts in dividing assets and ensuring that the children have adequate housing and financial support.

{"3751": "\n\nThe 2-month extension is granted automatically. You simply need to attach a statement to your return explaining which of the two situations listed earlier qualified you for the extension, as Pete Becker mentioned in the comments. According to IRS pub 54, for the \"regular\" 6-month extension, you can file the Form 4868 to request an extension if you cannot make it by the June deadline. The automatic 6-month extension is granted upon request, but it only extends the time to file, not to pay. To get this automatic extension, you must file a paper Form 4868 or use IRS e-file. Keep in mind that the due date is still April 15th (18th this year), so the 6-month extension pushes it back to October. \n\nIf you cannot file your return within the automatic 2-month extension period, you can get an additional 4 months to file your return, for a total of 6 months. The 2-month period and the 6-month period start at the same time. You must request the additional 4 months by the new due date allowed by the 2-month extension. It is possible to ask for an additional 2 months extension to push it further to December; however, this is no longer automatic. You can find more information in the publication. Please note that these extensions are for filing only, not for paying. \n\nTo avoid the penalty, you are expected to submit a payment that will cover your tax liability (at least in the ballpark). The interest rate is low (less than 1% right now), but there is a penalty which may be pretty substantial if you do not pay enough by the due date. There are \"safe harbor\" rules that you can follow to avoid the penalty. Please refer to IRS tax topic 301 for more information."}

Although the 2017 model was only $100 more than the 2016 model (which I was considering), the 2016 model had a sticker price $3,000 below the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP).

You can shop around for better insurance deals but the fees are generally not significant. The realtor fee can be split between the buyer and seller, but you can avoid it entirely if neither party has a realtor. While discounts and timing the closing date can reduce what you owe at closing, they don't save you money in the long run.

While GDP measures an economy's growth and stock market is driven by company profits, investor mentality heavily influences the stock market, causing it to be more volatile than GDP ever can be. The 2001 bubble and 2008 panic sell-off serve as famous examples of this. Emerging markets are particularly prone to overly optimistic buying and overly pessimistic selling due to changing politics. Furthermore, GDP measurements are done after the fact, meaning the growth that is reported has already happened, whereas the stock market may have already priced in the growth. Governments and companies in emerging markets also have a reputation for poor governance, which can make investors skeptical of growth opportunities. It is worth noting that despite a rough decade, emerging markets have returned an annualized return of 9% if held since 2001."}
{"3759": "\n\nThe ideal down payment is 0% only if the interest rate on the car loan is also 0%. However, as the interest rate increases, it becomes more advantageous to pay for the car in full. This decision is typically binary, meaning that based on the interest rate, you should either make a 0% down payment or pay in full. Determining the best option depends on several factors. If you can invest the amount of the down payment at a higher rate of return than the interest rate on the car loan, a 0% down payment is optimal. Inflation is another factor that could influence the decision. By combining the inflation rate with the rate of return on investments, you can determine the tipping point for making a down payment. If the interest rate on the car loan is less than the combined inflation rate and the return on investments, a lower down payment is preferable. However, it is important to ensure that you invest the money as planned. Another reason for minimizing the down payment would be if you have outstanding loans with a higher interest rate than the car loan. In this case, pay off the higher interest loans before making a down payment on the car. Some dealers may offer cash back incentives for paying for the car in full. If this option is available, it is important to compare the benefits of paying in full versus carrying a loan. To ensure the best possible deal, negotiate the price of the car before revealing how you plan to pay for it."}

{"3761": "\n\nOffsetting taxable gains means that the amount of $25 million can be deducted from another sum that the company would have to pay tax on. For example, if the company made a profit of $100 million from other investments, they would have to pay corporation tax on that amount before distributing it as a cash dividend to shareholders. However, if they can offset the $25 million, they would only need to pay tax on $75 million. This is standard practice as tax is usually paid on the aggregate of gains and losses. If corporation tax is approximately 32%, the claimed saving would be around $8 million. The Plaintiffs may be seeking to sell the stock on the market to achieve this tax saving, as they may not see the same effect by distributing it directly. It is unclear whether the Plaintiffs are correct in their approach, but there could be a difference in the treatment of the stock as a \"realized loss\" if it is sold versus distributed. Additionally, if the loss is not realized when distributed, the shareholders' \"cost basis\" could be the original purchase price of the stock, which could provide a tax advantage. However, this is all speculative."}

The low-risk nature of cash and bonds is advantageous, especially during market crashes or other adverse events when having no low-risk assets results in no savings to fall back on. A diversified portfolio containing bonds and equities allows for a modest return while managing risks. However, some bonds may be equally risky as equities, and any bond offering excessively high-interest rates might indicate a questionable repayment entity.

In fact, I have successfully negotiated such refunds in the past with my own bank, in cases where I felt that certain fees were not justified. Whether or not your bank agrees to a refund will depend on how much they value your business. If your account is otherwise profitable, they may be willing to accommodate your request."}

Alternatively, if your loan allows for it (not all do), you can make additional payments to lower the principal of the loan, decreasing both the amount and duration of the loan and potentially reducing the total interest paid. However, this may require you to pay an additional sum up front or increase your monthly payments. Returning the car is not an option; a new car's value depreciates drastically the moment it's driven off the dealer's lot, making it unsellable for its original price. Even selling it as a recent model used car will result in a net loss. It's better to keep the car and refinance or pay it off instead. Remember to carefully read and understand all paperwork before signing in the future.

{"3769": "\n\nWhile this text touches on misconceptions related to personal finance, there are several points that could benefit from clarification. The concept of \"pass-through\" insurance is misleading; what is actually being described is a self-funded plan. In a self-funded arrangement, an employer contracts a third-party-administrator (TPA) to use its provider network for medical claims processing and the like. Additionally, each plan participant typically has stop-loss insurance coverage, which provides coverage up to a certain dollar amount. Employers are responsible for covering costs that fall between the plan deductible and the stop-loss coverage, assuming the stop-loss benefit does not have a maximum. \n\nWhile it is true that a very small percentage of individual claims will account for most of the costs in a given plan, these costs generally arise from unforeseen and serious conditions like cancer rather than chronic issues like diabetes medication. \n\nIt is important to note that employer insurance can fall into four categories: small group, mid-market, large-group, and self-funded. Small-group insurance is tightly regulated, and premiums are filed with a state authority with no room for negotiation. Employers have no access to employee-specific medical or claim information. Mid-market insurance is pooled, meaning overall pool performance can impact premiums. Employers may receive limited claims data but no employee-specific information. Large-group insurance is usually unpooled, and carriers may offload some risk to a stop-loss carrier. Employers receive more claims insight than with mid-market insurance but still no employee names. Self-funded insurance is self-contained, with employers setting up an account to handle claims payment. Employee ID cards may have the carrier logo, but the TPA handles claims processing. Benefits committees of a few people generally have insight into claims and stop-loss activity. \n\nThere are also partially self-funded arrangements with a low-threshold stop-loss program, intended to help mid-market employers reduce medical spending. It is incorrect to assume that employers screen for health deficiencies as part of the hiring process. Hiring managers are not instructed to do so by law, and lawsuits from potential discrimination issues could cost more than $50,000 per year. Moreover, severe childbirth can run up costs of $250,000 or more; would these companies not hire women? Similarly, a diagnosis like leukemia could produce $1,000,000 or more in costs. \n\nWhile this text provides a useful overview, it is important to note that hiring managers do not have insight into specific claims-related information, nor is any medical information requested on a resume. It may also be possible to fine-tune certain points or areas of emphasis, but overall the text provides a broad picture of the self-insured employer benefit landscape."}

This includes identifying your average monthly expenses, knowing the interest rates of your loans, and understanding what you are saving for. It is also crucial to have an emergency fund in place, which should ideally cover 4 to 6 months of expenses and be based on your actual expenses rather than your income. As your circumstances change, such as having children, your emergency fund should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nOnce you have established your emergency fund, you can focus on paying off high-interest loans first. This strategy is mathematically the most effective in the long term, as you will save money on interest payments. However, it is important to research and make informed decisions about paying off loans with low interest rates, such as a mortgage.\n\nAfter paying off high-interest loans, you can consider investing in vehicles that align with your financial goals. For instance, if you plan on having children in the next five years, you may want to invest in a college education fund. In this case, it is wise to opt for investments that have low risk and are accessible after a certain period of time, such as bonds or deposits.\n\nThese are just a few basic tips to help you manage your personal finance.

Resident aliens are taxed the same as US citizens, with an approximate tax rate of 25% for an annual remuneration as indicated in the tax brackets provided by http://www.moneychimp.com/features/tax_brackets.htm. The determination of your residency status depends on your period of stay in the US, with an exemption for non-resident aliens whose tax home is outside the US, such as India. To establish your residency category, refer to http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc851.html, taking note that if you are assessed as a resident alien, even your Indian income will be taxed in the US unless you declare that there is no income in India.\n\nMeanwhile, your tax liability in India depends on your non-resident Indian (NRI) status, which is also linked to your duration of stay in the country. To be considered an NRI, you must be absent from India for at least 183 days in a financial year. Only Indian residents are obligated to pay taxes on their entire income, with the possibility of being taxed in both India and the US if you are classified as a citizen of both nations.

{"3788": "\n\nExposure refers to the potential loss one may face on a given position, portfolio, strategy or counterparty, usually represented as a percentage of total assets. Interbank exposure denotes the risk that banks face while dealing with other banks, which could be through their holdings in debt or stock or through open positions as counterparties. Leveraging occurs when the value of a position exceeds the trading cost. This can be achieved through borrowing money to trade or by purchasing futures on margin. The problem with leveraged positions is the risk of cascading losses and defaults, particularly in the event of a credit crisis, as banks pass on their debt to other banks, which can lead to a collapse of the entire trade. If a leveraged position becomes worth less than the actual investment amount, the firm may default on the leverage requirements, which could lead to contagion and losses for other firms holding the debt."}
{"3789": "\n\nIn Canada, there are various methods of tax deferral that Revenue Canada permits. These methods, however, do not let you avoid paying taxes altogether. They merely allow you to defer taxes from high-income years to lower-income years, leading to a reduced overall tax bill due to the marginal rate for personal income tax. One such method is the corporate dividend approach, as explained in another answer. TFSAs are an alternative, but they come with certain limits. Regarding tax deferral, the best and simplest option available in Canada is the RRSP. If you do not have a company pension, you may contribute up to 18% of your income. Even if you have a pension plan, you may still contribute to an RRSP, but the maximum amount of contribution will be less. Contributing to an RRSP lowers your taxable income, resulting in tax savings. Furthermore, interest earned on the equity in your RRSP is not taxed. Only when you withdraw money from the plan, it is considered income in that year, and taxes are applied. RRSPs are designated for retirement, but you can withdraw from them at any time. Suppose you have little or no income in a year. In that case, you may withdraw from your RRSP, and while tax is withheld at that time, you may get some or all of it back based on your taxable income for the year. In essence, RRSPs enable you to balance your income and lower your legitimate tax obligations."}

Find ways to tuck away money for this specific goal, and take into account not just the down payment, but also the added expenses of insurance, taxes, and maintenance costs. If the total expenses are lower than those of renting, then buying is likely the better choice. However, this may not always be the case. When you are ready to purchase a home, ensure you have at least 20% of the total cost as a down payment, as well as an emergency fund that can cover three months of increased living expenses. For a single person, this could easily be over $10k per month, including mortgage, utilities, and food. As a homeowner, you will inevitably face unexpected expenses, such as a new roof for $5k, an HVAC system for $6k, exterior paint for $1.5k, a plumber for $500, pest control for $750, and a fallen tree removal for $250. Additionally, periodic costs, such as a new fridge for $1k, a new water heater for $500, and new washer and dryer for $1.2k will inevitably arise. It's not a question of if, but when these expenses will arise, and having an emergency fund in place will ensure you are prepared for them."}

If you have disposable income, you may be able to fully fund an IRA and a 401K each year and still have some money left over. To determine whether you want to fund your 401K beyond employer matching, consider reviewing the fees. There are various approaches to building an emergency fund, ranging from saving x months' salary to planning for each expense in detail. Regardless of the approach, it is crucial to consider your risk tolerance and create a strategy that addresses your specific needs. Constantly worrying about your situation can make it challenging to perform well at work; having a solid emergency plan in place can ease such worries. While you may fear becoming obsolete and struggling to keep up in your career as you reach midlife, such concerns may be unfounded. Although changes to your body, mind, and abilities are inevitable, it can be challenging to predict where you will be, what you will be doing, and how your experience will offset potential decreases in your ability to keep up. It is wise to consider possible scenarios, but bear in mind that such situations are not predetermined. Being 40 is not a special age that forces you to switch to a different line of work if you do not want to."}

At a minimum, we would need to know her location to provide useful options. Therefore, my generic suggestions are:\n\n1. Contact the mortgage companies and explain that she can no longer make the payments. This could result in foreclosure on the properties, and if she still owes money afterward, she may have to declare bankruptcy, depending on whether her state is \"non-recourse\" (US). This option is not advisable, except as a last resort since it is a drastic step that wipes the slate clean and provides some level of certainty.\n\n2. Examine the portfolio of properties carefully, obtaining accurate evaluations of them (which may be free, depending on location), and analyzing the property market to determine whether rental rates/prices are increasing or decreasing. Subsequently, determine case-by-case whether each property should be retained or sold. Discounts on fees may be possible if multiple transactions are made. This option would require objective analysis and decision-making without emotional investments in the properties.\n\n3. Depending on how she obtained the properties, it may be possible to sue whoever recommended the properties as an investment option. A large, deteriorating property portfolio is not a viable investment for an elder, and if they were purchased based on consultation with an investment advisor, there might be legal recourse.\n\n4. Could the properties be utilized as a means of reducing costs? For instance, could she inhabit one of the properties to cut costs? If she owns her home, she could sell it, live in one of the rental properties, and utilize the funds to fund the sale of the other rentals.\n\n5. Lastly, do not intermingle your finances with hers, by taking out a mortgage on your personal property, for instance. If you have the financial resources to assist her within your budget, that's fine. However, it's advisable to restrict it to things such as buying groceries. If she's heading toward bankruptcy, you don't want to become embroiled in her finances."}

For example, for a young person starting their career, it's essential to match any work pension plan and consider emergency savings. Maintaining six months worth of spending or income is crucial, so don't put all your money in long-term investments. Avoiding high-interest debt and PMI on mortgages should also be a priority. Additional retirement savings, such as a Roth IRA or 401k, should also be explored. \n\nAfter considering these steps, it's essential to check with a tax accountant and consider using any additional money for investments, such as real estate or businesses. However, if it's too much effort, that's okay too. For retirement plans, consider where you want to live and vacation and buy property accordingly. \n\nFor any possessions you have, consider selling or donating them, but only if it's practical and doesn't hold significant sentimental value.

{"3797": "\n\nIn general, it is true that existing fixed-rate bonds - and therefore ETFs that hold those bonds - become less valuable when interest rates rise. This impact is greater for bonds that are further from maturity. However, once the bonds do mature, the fund can replace them at a market price, which means that the effect gradually decreases. To understand this effect, the bond market uses a metric called \"duration,\" which measures the average time from now to each bond payout, weighted by the payout. The longer the duration, the greater the price change for a given interest rate change. Although there are different ways to calculate duration, a rough approximation is that a bond's price will decrease by a percentage equal to the duration times the increase in interest rates. For example, a bond with a duration of 5 years will lose 5% of its value for a 1% increase in interest rates. \n\nRegarding your second question, whether diversification is beneficial depends on your investment goals. If you seek lower risk, short-term bonds may be a better option, but both short-term and long-term bonds will lose value if the issuer is in financial trouble. Generally, government bonds (gilts) are seen as less risky than corporate bonds. If you would like more information on diversification, it may be beneficial to pose a separate question with additional details."}
{"3798": "\n\nAn economy produces goods and services, and people use money to purchase them. The value of money is determined by the confidence people have in their ability to buy and sell with it within the economy. The amount of money in circulation relative to goods and services (supply and demand) determines its worth. In most economies, the federal/national reserve bank is responsible for maintaining stable prices, which is crucial for a well-functioning economy. The federal reserve bank achieves this by regulating the supply of money, such as printing more or decreasing interest rates, to stabilize the economy. It is challenging to determine the ideal amount of money required to keep prices stable due to numerous factors. If the amount of money is higher than goods and services, prices will rise, resulting in inflation. If the opposite is true, then it's deflation. Since deflation is more damaging to an economy than inflation, reserve banks tend to lean towards maintaining inflation."}

Once you reach the pre-tax contribution limit (which was $17.5k in 2014), you have the option to make contributions on a post-tax basis. These contributions are referred to as \"spillover\" contributions due to their timing. Typically, this option is marketed as a way to receive company match, even if the pre-tax limit has been met accidentally. However, if you are mindful of your finances, it presents a convenient opportunity to put additional tax-advantaged money towards savings. It is important to note that you would only want to consider this option once you have already reached the maximum limit for pre-tax and Roth contributions. Contributions made on a post-tax basis do not yield the tax breaks offered by the other two options, for contributions or earnings. Nevertheless, upon leaving your employer, you may transfer post-tax funds directly into a Roth IRA, while pre-tax contributions, match, and earnings may be transferred to a traditional IRA."}
{"3815": "\n\nI concur with your suggestion to consolidate your debt with a loan, but it may be challenging to secure an unsecured personal loan from a bank or credit organization for the amount you need. One option to consider is Lending Club, a loan facilitation platform where loans are dispersed among multiple investors who each contribute a small amount, typically $25. They provide loans with rates ranging from 5-30%, depending on your credit profile, and they may offer loan amounts that match your requirements. However, please note that I'm an investor on this platform, and I'm not endorsing it, but it's the only option that comes to mind immediately.\n\nIf you plan to buy a house, I advise you to save at least 20% for a downpayment. Anything less than that may necessitate paying for PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance), which is an additional cost that remains until you reach a 20% downpayment or the value of the home. Reducing your credit card debt should be your top priority, and you should also recommend the same to your father. Consolidating your debts with a loan can help you to reduce interest charges, and a fixed payment plan can make it easier for you to pay off the debt. Whether you choose to pay off your credit card debt using your savings account is a personal decision that you must make. If you believe that withdrawing funds from your tax-free savings account may incur tax penalties, you should avoid doing so.\n\nRemember to treat debt, especially credit card debt, as an emergency at all times. Credit card debt should be temporary, and their rates and fees are structured that way, which is why you should consolidate it into a loan if it is likely to remain outstanding for an extended period."}

Holding your money in a single fund family within an IRA has advantages. Moving money from one mutual fund or ETF to another within the fund family is easy and doesn't trigger taxes as long as it remains a retirement account. You have decades before you need the money, so your initial investment of $10,000 is just the start. You are not locked into your investment choices and can adjust your allocations periodically.

The formula for a long position with margin is represented by, and for a short position by, where P_m is the maintenance margin price, P_i is the initial margin price, m_i is the initial margin rate, and m_m is the maintenance margin rate. However, this calculation may become intricate when dealing with different asset classes, as each has a unique maintenance margin.

If you decide to sell and purchase another home in the same neighborhood, you may not see any net gain. This is why I often remind people that a house is not an investment in the traditional sense. Of course, if you're renting out the property, it becomes a business. But as a place of residence, it's simply housing. While there is potential to make a profit when selling, it's not a guarantee. A house does store value, but accessing that value can be difficult unless you take out loans against it. However, the lower loan rates you may receive when borrowing against your home may not be worth it if you can avoid borrowing altogether. For me personally, I was able to leverage my home's value by taking out a very low-rate mortgage instead of paying cash upfront. This allowed me to keep more money invested in other areas, which is arguably one of the safest forms of leverage."}
{"3824": "\n\nRevised: Sovereign immunity acts as a safeguard for states when facing potential bankruptcy as they hold the power to define and customize their own bankruptcy laws within the framework of federal law. When a creditor is not paid, they may seek legal recourse, yet the state can invoke sovereign immunity, as seen in cases such as Hans v. Louisiana and Alden v. Maine. Breaking through this immunity would require taking the state to federal court and attempting to force them into bankruptcy, sparking a clash between state and federal authority. However, the federal government is often inclined to side with the state, resulting in a costly and arduous legal battle that may even reach the Supreme Court. The rarity of this situation is due to its negative impact on the state's credit, and thus, the state and business sectors aim to avoid it. Hence, when lending to states, creditors need to consider the possibility of the state invoking its \"nuclear option\" of sovereign immunity."}
{"3825": "\n\nI would like to add another point to ChrisinEdmonton's answer. While it may be appropriate as a comment or a partial answer, I feel that the comment formatting is inadequate to express my thoughts fully. The crux of the matter is this simple formula: (Capital Invested) * (Rate of Return) = (Income per Period). When ChrisinEdmonton states that you need $300,000, he is applying basic algebra. The formula for Capital Required is: (Income per Period) / (Rate of Return). So, let's say you have a goal of $12,000 per year in passive income and a reasonably stable 4% yield. The calculation would be: $12,000 / 0.04 = $300,000. You can use this formula to explore different rates of return and investment options.\n\nInvestment categories like REITs have higher dividend yields of around 8% to 12% but also pose more significant risks to your capital. This would require an investment of $100,000 to $150,000. However, the safest options would be bonds or industrial stocks that pay dividends. Bonds have yields of around 3% to 4%, and industrial dividend stocks like GE, UTX, or Coca-Cola tend to pay roughly 2% to 3%.\n\nThe key takeaway is that if you are looking to generate a passive income, don't rely on investment gains to achieve your goal. ChrisinEdmonton did not make this entirely clear. Spending down your portfolio can be complex and expensive."}

Each state has its own regulations on what health insurance companies must cover and at what price. In NY, for example, insurers cannot charge different rates based on age.

{"3829": "\n\nThis started as a comment but I felt it was too long, so I am posting it as an answer. @yarun, like you, I am not an accountant but I have found GnuCash to be an excellent tool for learning more about accounting. By understanding the 5 principal accounts and learning about debits and credits, you can gain knowledge about the centuries-old double-entry system that all accountants use. It may seem daunting, but it's easier than you think.\n\nEven if you don't balance the amounts exactly, GnuCash is still incredibly useful for tracking your monthly expenses. Customize reports and save configurations so that you can quickly access updated data. Initially, if you're unsure about transactions, classify them as \"Unaccounted Expenses\" so that you can see how much money you've spent without a clear understanding of where it went. As you learn more, you can re-classify them correctly and reduce the number of unaccounted expenses in your reports.\n\nTo start, import transactions from the past 6-12 months, and GnuCash will gradually learn to categorize them. You still need to review every transaction upon import, as sometimes expenses may be categorized incorrectly (e.g., petrol expenses classified as groceries). The reports help identify any abnormalities, and it's easy to make modifications and save custom reports. Keep in mind that your report configurations are saved on your computer and are not part of the GnuCash file, so if you switch computers, you have to export your configurations.\n\nOnce you start entering transactions proactively, on the day or week you incur the expense, you gain more control, and you'll need to match them with bank statements. Use Equity: Opening Balances to manipulate starting balances for the current balances to match the bank's balance. When you manually enter transactions proactively, later imports from the bank statement will match automatically and become reconciled.\n\nIn my experience, this process takes time, but it's worth it. I recommend starting slowly and asking questions if needed. Personal finance is more about behavior than math, and GnuCash helps you keep an overview of your money. Finally, it's best to use GnuCash on a laptop that you use regularly."}
{"3830": "\n\nThere are two approaches to determining the price of a future contract on the day prior to expiration. The cost of carry model states that the price equals the spot price plus the cost of carrying the underlying asset until expiration, minus the return that can be obtained from carrying the asset. In equation form, this is written as FuturePrice = SpotPrice + (CarryCost - CarryReturn). \n\nAlternatively, the expectancy model asserts that the futures contract price is based on expectations about the future price of the underlying asset. In this scenario, the futures price may diverge from the spot price depending on the expected rise or fall in price before expiration. \n\nFor reference, the cost of carry generally includes storage expenses, insurance, and finance charges incurred while holding a physical commodity. In the interest rate futures market, it refers to the difference between the yield on a cash instrument and the cost of funding necessary to purchase the instrument. The spot price represents the price at which a physical commodity sells for immediate delivery at a particular time and location. It is often referred to as the cash price."}

If you receive a Subscription Right from PSEC and do not sell or exercise it before it expires, you will generally have taxable dividend income equal to the fair market value of the Subscription Right on the date of distribution by PSEC, to the extent of PSEC's current and accumulated earnings and profits. You will also have a capital loss upon the expiration of the right equal to your adjusted tax basis in the right. It is important to note that the dividend taxable events occur on the date of distribution by PSEC, while the capital loss occurs upon the expiration of the right.

Those numbers would be more appropriate. \n\nTo give you an example of how to calculate the profit and loss from a leveraged futures contract, let's use the E-mini S&P500 contract, which is well-known. Each contract is worth $50 multiplied by the value of the S&P 500 index, and has a tick size of 0.25, which means that the minimum price change is 0.25 multiplied by $50, or $12.50. \n\nLet's assume that the current value of the S&P500 is 1,600, which means the value of each contract is $50 multiplied by 1,600, or $80,000. If you purchase one contract on margin with an initial margin requirement of 5%, or $4,000, and the S&P 500 index rises to 1,610, the value of your futures contract will increase to $50 multiplied by 1,610, or $80,500. Once you return the $76,000 that you borrowed as leverage, your profit will be $80,500 minus $76,000, which equals $4,500. \n\nSince you used $4,000 of your own funds as an initial margin, your profit, excluding commissions, will be $4,500 minus $4,000, which equals $500, giving you a 12.5% return. However, if the index drops to 1,580, the value of your futures contract will decrease to $50 multiplied by 1,580, or $79,000. After you return the $76,000 in leverage, you'll be left with $3,000, resulting in a net loss of (3,000 minus 4,000) divided by 4,000, which equals -25%. This illustrates why using leverage increases your risk but also has the potential for a greater return. \n\nIf you had not used margin and spent $80,000 of your own funds, your profit would be (80,500 minus 80,000) divided by 80,000, or .625%, which is significantly smaller than your leveraged profit, by a factor of 20, which is the inverse of the margin requirement (.625% divided by .05 = 12.5%). Using leverage in this case dramatically increased your rate of return. \n\nHowever, if the index decreased and you spent $80,000 but gained only $79,000, your loss would be only 1.25%, which is 20 times smaller than your negative return when using leverage. By avoiding leverage, you decrease your potential for upside but also decrease your downside risk. \n\nNote that for futures contracts, the margin requirements are set by the exchange, which is CME Group in the case of the E-mini. The 5% margin requirement in my example is higher than the actual margin requirement, which is currently $3,850 USD per contract, but it is used for simplicity. Also, note that CME Group refers to the initial margin as the performance bond."}

The TD Ameritrade chart seems to be the most reliable, showing returns with reinvested dividends. CNN most likely shows reinvested dividends for quoted securities but not for the S&P 500 index, while Yahoo probably shows all returns without reinvested dividends. TD's chart for the S&P 500 index fund VFINX appears to be consistent with reality, whereas Yahoo's charts for both ABALX and VFINX disagree with Yahoo's own historical data. A historical S&P 500 return estimator indicates a 97.1% return with reinvested dividends between July 2012 to July 2017, compared to raw returns of 78.4%. CNN claims a 35% growth for the S&P 500 index over the last five years, while Yahoo claims 45%."}

{"3838": "\n\nRevised: If the cost of repairing a car is more than its value, it's not worth it. Instead, browse Craigslist for another second-hand car that fits within your budget. Before buying, have a mechanic inspect the car. Refer to Consumer Reports to find a reliable model. As you don't need an expensive car, it's better to buy several cheap ones in succession that you can pay for in cash. Avoid building your credit by financing your car. Instead, use a credit card with a low limit to make monthly purchases and pay it off in full every month. Take time to find a good-priced car and a favourable rate before purchasing; don't base your decision on monthly payments alone. Pay in cash until you qualify for a loan from a credit union or bank with a low-interest rate. If you must borrow, secure a pre-approved loan first before negotiating with the dealer. Don't let the dealer do all the financing for you."}

Specifically, check out the \"Reports > Income/Expense > Income Statement\" report, which summarizes your income and spending over a default time frame of the current year. Each report you run has an \"Options\" button at the top of the screen, where you can set the time frame to display, such as the two-week span since your last paycheck. Additionally, explore other features like the Expense charts & statements, the \"Cash Flow\" report, and the \"Budgeting\" interface (although it may take some time to learn). \n\nThe best practices for tracking your spending also apply regardless of software used, but a good financial tracking program can enhance these practices. For instance, in our household, we have multiple credit cards which we pay in full every month. We choose these cards based on their specific benefits, such as cash back for certain business types. We use one card exclusively for eating out, another for groceries, and another for gas, making it easy to see how much we spend in each category. This method aligns with the account structure in GnuCash."}

During the twelve months preceding March 2009, banks were facing losses due to mortgage-backed securities, resulting in negative earnings, causing a collapse in earnings across the economy. Consequently, the S&P500's earnings fell to 78% of the previous year's earnings. Despite the market decline, investors were forward-looking and started to factor in the possibility of improved earnings by May 2009. The S&P500 saw a 33% increase in just two months, demonstrating that prices were not suffering as much as reported trailing earnings. Therefore, the high P/E value reported in May 2009 was anomalous."}

While diversification is a sound strategy, it can be too complex and costly for individual investors. Moreover, it requires periodic rebalancing.

Verify that you are on the correct website if using online services. Keep meticulous records, including the name and/or ID of the person with whom you spoke and any relevant call numbers, tracking numbers, transmission receipts, or other data. If uncertain about why certain information is being requested, ask the fraud department for an explanation. You can also request secure transmission of sensitive materials or confirm that said security measures are in place. Remember that both you and the fraud department share the goal of preventing corporate loss, which may mean treating customers well and preventing legal violations. However, it is crucial to allow fraud departments to perform their jobs effectively by cooperating where possible. If your case involves identity theft, document the issue thoroughly for potential use with law enforcement.

{"3844": "\n\nI'm not sure if you've considered all of the options available. It's true that subtracting $X from B may not be feasible, but it's worth comparing the NPV(B) to $Y. Our objective is not to determine the return on B but to determine our next course of action. Sunk costs can be disregarded in our planning process. However, in our return calculation, it's important to note that A was not a viable option. For this, we would need to include $X in the expenses for B. And for the second alternative, we would subtract $X from $Y (which may be negative).\n\nIt's important not to mix up the concept of sunk costs in planning and retrospective analysis. When reflecting on the costs of B, the $X will be factored in. Nonetheless, prior to starting B and having spent the $X, we only have the building and must decide based on the available options. $Y can be regarded as the opportunity cost of B \u2013 it's either to sell for $Y or to undertake B. B should only be pursued if it's worth more than $Y.\n\nThe sunk cost fallacy would be if we compare B to $X. If $Y is lower than $X, this may lead us to forgo B even if it's the best path forward. For example, if $Y < NPV(B) < $X, pursuing the project would result in loss, but it would be less costly than if we sold out. Similarly, if $Y < $X < NPV(B) or $X < $Y < NPV(B), B should still be undertaken. Generally speaking, B should be pursued any time NPV(B) is greater than $Y. The only time B should not be pursued is when NPV(B) is less than $Y. If NPV(B) and $Y are identical, financially, it wouldn't matter whether B is undertaken or not."}

{"3847": "\n\nThe responses you will receive will mainly differ among individuals. I cannot advise you on which option is best for you, but there are several factors to consider. Firstly, are you familiar with the selling process? If your target market is competitive, then it might be best to go the FSBO route as you may not require the marketing expertise of a real estate agent. In markets where there is high demand, pricing your home correctly could lead to multiple offers being submitted for your property, which could complicate the process. Do you have an accurate understanding of your property's value in your target market? Are you working with accurate figures or relying on websites such as Zillow? Additionally, do you understand the paperwork necessary to finalize a FSBO transaction? Negotiation skills will also come in handy as buyers with an agent will require a percentage of the sale's proceeds as commission. FSBO resources exist, but there may be a considerable learning curve involved that could be overwhelming.\n\nFSBO does not come without cost; buyers with agents will expect a commission of about 3% for their part in the sale. Without prior experience in negotiating, you may end up leaving money on the table. Moreover, an experienced agent may demand contingencies throughout the negotiation process. Besides, you may have to pay for marketing expenses and take time off from work to showcase your home. However, if you reside in a region where buyers come to you, the sale could be relatively hassle-free.\n\nTraditional agents charge a fee, but it goes towards marketing, sales experience, and negotiations. They handle the process of exposing your property to prospective clients and booking showings. They work on your behalf, eliminating the need to adjust your work schedule often, unlike FSBO. They only get paid once your house sells. Limited service agents (LSAs) are not well-known to me, but it's expected that buyers will have agents, so LSA fees will likely be high. $500 is the minimum LSA fee, which appears to be paid regardless of whether the house sells. It seems like you're paying a fee to market and feature your house on their list, with no guarantee of selling. In my view, you may receive the same exposure as an informed FSBO seller."}

With various factors such as technology, monetary policy, economic thinking, social needs, and market expectations constantly evolving, the fabric of markets is continuously being altered. While economic projections may fail in their most basic form, it is important to acknowledge that economics is like warfare, with constant shifts that challenge our assumptions and create new circumstances that are difficult to predict.\n\nIn the past, people who bet on large-scale mechanized warfare between western powers continuing post nuclear weapons were proven wrong. This is just one example of how the world can change unexpectedly, and these shifts can have significant impacts on finance that are often overlooked or forgotten. Innovations such as public ownership of stock, bonds, mortgages, and insurance have changed the world forever and created structural shifts in economies, growth rates, and societal interactions.\n\nAs predicting growth is crucial in the game of economics, it is common for individuals or groups to overextend on new innovations while neglecting others.

Although such patrons have purchased a service, they may lack the comprehension that their time and resource consumption may also affect the provider.

However, it does affect your cost basis when determining capital gains or losses upon realization. For example, publicly-traded REITs distribute a return of capital as a nondividend distribution. This is not a share of profits but rather a return of a portion of the original capital investment. The return of capital changes the cost basis, which must be adjusted when the shares are sold. More information about the S-Corp's business activities is needed to determine if there are actual capital gains or losses."}

{"3872": "There are various options available to you when placing a stock order, depending on the type of orders offered by your broker. Placing a limit order at the top of bids the night before market open may put you at risk if bid and offer prices increase by the time the market opens the next day. Conversely, if bid and offer prices fall at market open, your order should be filled at or below your limit price. You could also monitor the market at open and determine the price and quantity you want to buy based on market trends. However, this method is not recommended, as emotional reactions can lead to chasing the market or regretting a purchase. The best approach is to use stop orders to enter and exit the market. With a stop buy order, you can trigger a buy at a predetermined price, such as above $10.01, and then place a market or limit order above that trigger price. This ensures a more objective, data-driven approach to investing, and avoids emotional reactions. Ultimately, as a long-term investor, it is more important to buy when prices show signs of rising than falling. Following market trends and using stop orders can help you achieve the best outcome."}
{"3873": "\n\nInvestopedia defines an asset as \"overbought\" when it experiences sharp upward movements over a short period of time. The extent to which an asset can be overbought varies depending on the investor's subjective assessment. Technical analysts use various indicators such as the relative strength index, the stochastic oscillator, and the money flow index to identify overbought securities. In contrast to oversold securities, overbought securities have more potential buyers than sellers, which can drive the price up to unsustainably high levels. This may result in a price correction that can send the price down rapidly. A real-life example of an oversold or overbought scenario can be found in the airline industry, where overbooking of flights can result in passengers being bumped from the flight. The same applies to IPOs in the stock market, where an increase in demand for shares can drive up the price, making it more difficult for buyers to find sellers to complete transactions. The potential in the market is unseen and what attracts buyers and sellers can affect the price shift. It is also important to note that stocks have a finite quantity, as only a limited number of shares are traded for a company at any given time."}

{"3882": "\n\nThe Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) provided loans totaling approximately $475 billion to institutions, which are required to be repaid with interest (although at a low rate). Nevertheless, a significant percentage of these loans have been, or will be, paid back, resulting in a final price tag that is relatively low compared to the scale of the program. In contrast, there is around $10 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding, which represents a much higher price tag than TARP. Furthermore, unlike TARP loans that are repaid to the government, paying off mortgages would not generate repayment to the government. Consequently, the initial cost of such a plan would be around $10 trillion, which is significantly more than just a few billion dollars. Additionally, considering that the US government already has a debt exceeding $15 trillion, raising another $10 trillion to pay off people's mortgages would be challenging. In this regard, resorting to borrowing more money or increasing the money supply to finance such an initiative could trigger inflation and exacerbate the debt crisis further.\n\nIt is important to note that the principal balance of a mortgage is only a fraction of the amounts paid to the bank over a 30-year term. The interest paid over this period is significant, and banks build this revenue into their financial projections. Therefore, if these revenue streams were to disappear suddenly, it could have significant repercussions for the financial industry. Moreover, many people bought houses during the real estate boom when housing prices were inflated far beyond their actual value. Granting these people a mortgage holiday could further reward banks for accepting inflated values during the appraisal process, which was partly responsible for the financial crisis.\n\nLastly, the financial crisis was triggered by people buying houses they could not afford. Therefore, rewarding such behavior with a free house would not be a fair solution, particularly at the expense of taxpayers who had a prudent approach to their finances. Loan modifications, which force banks to accept the \"real\" value of the house, are a more equitable alternative."}

{"3890": "\n\nIf your investments are in a taxable account instead of a retirement account, you may not be able to avoid short-term capital gains if you sell them now. To minimize taxes, however, there are a few strategies you can consider. One is to donate some of your stock to a charitable organization before selling it. Another is to transfer some of the stock to a family member with a lower tax bracket, but this approach is subject to many rules and gift limits and may not be practical for children or full-time students. A third option is to buy puts to protect your gains, but this can be expensive, so it's important to calculate the return on investment. Alternatively, you could wait until the long-term capital gains rate kicks in, which will lock in your gains but won't allow you to benefit from any potential appreciation in the future. If all else fails, a final option is to hold onto your investments until you pass away, as the \"step-up\" basis on capital gains for estates can be beneficial.

If you are currently renting and struggling to save up enough for a larger down payment, it could take a considerable amount of time to come up with an additional $11,000.

{"3896": "\n\nJB King provided an excellent answer, stating that companies typically repurchase shares at market price from the open market. However, they may focus on larger stakeholders, including controlling interests that express interest in divesting. If this investor were to sell their shares on the open market, both parties could be unhappy with the resulting drop in prices. In such cases, the company may offer an incentive price that exceeds market rates. Recently, the US government has been the primary investor seeking to divest. As they received stocks in return for bailouts, they were able to make a modest profit from many of them, but not enough to compensate for the entire bailout. The '80s saw the emergence of a specific buy-back strategy called the \"leveraged buyout\".

{"3897": "\n\nIn order to perform a proper analysis, it is important to use the net inflow or net outflow (profit or loss) when dealing with IRR. Confusion may arise because there are multiple uses for IRR, but essentially it is the same formula approached from different angles. For instance, when analyzing a stock or mutual fund investment, one may project an up-front investment (net outflow) in the first period, followed by positive returns (dividends and final sale proceeds - each a net inflow) in subsequent periods. This model closely follows logical reasoning. Conversely, when analyzing a business project or investment, the cash flow tend to be more complicated and less smooth, with large up-front capital expenditures, net profits (revenue less ongoing maintenance expense), new expenditures, and so on. Regardless, it is essential to base the analysis on the net inflow or net outflow in each period.

{"3899": "\n\nRevised:\n\nIn a real estate transaction, cash has to be handed over to the seller, even if no physical money is exchanged. Regardless of how the bank accounts for the disbursement of the loan, the result is the buyer has cash to give the seller, but is in debt to the bank for at least the same amount. Banks usually do not have that money sitting in their vault, as they only keep a fraction of the deposit balances required by the Feds. Instead, they turn to investors by issuing bonds and receiving money from bondholders which they use to fund loans. Banks lose money from defaults in two ways: loss of future interest payments and loss of collateral value. In the case of a foreclosure during a major economic downturn, banks are affected in both ways. Economic recession causes a reduction in demand for real estate, leading to a drop in prices. This, combined with overvalued homes, high interest rates and the bursting of the housing bubble, led to a double-whammy for mortgage lenders. The loss of collateral value and lowered demand have resulted in banks being stuck with thousands of homes they cannot sell at their original values, causing major losses. Even worse, the guarantor of these losses may also be in financial trouble. When homeowners find themselves underwater and financially unstable, they may prefer to walk away from the property, leaving the bank with more losses. This situation left banks nervous about signing new mortgages, as default risks increased, reducing demand and further decreasing prices. This has been the situation for the past five years, but there is a glimmer of hope with home sales picking up."}
{"3900": "There are taxes that do not rely on yearly income, but rather on how much a person owns or has. These taxes can be called a 'wealth tax' or 'capital tax.' Examples include foreign land ownership taxes in some countries like Italy, corporate taxes on amounts owned in Canada (formerly), and strict wealth taxes in Switzerland. In the United States, the Estate Tax is a form of wealth tax that is assessed when a person dies. The threshold for this tax is usually in the multiple millions and currently sits around $5 million. Even though these taxes may create an initial price shock, they have the potential to replace some of the existing income tax regime in many countries, without increasing the tax burden on their people. However, whether these taxes are effective or desirable is an economic question, rather than a personal finance issue.

This includes the fair market value of the fund along with any distributions (dividends) paid out. Vanguard specifically showcases the impact of fees in the chart since their low fees are a significant selling point. Dividends can be preferable to selling shares based on a few factors including no loss of voting power, no transaction costs, and potentially better tax consequences than capital gains.\n\nIt's essential to note that if your fund isn't meeting the benchmark, it's not due to the payment of dividends. Funds don't pay their own dividends; instead, they forward the dividends paid out by the companies they invest in to shareholders. Thus, the fair market value of the fund should always reflect the fair market value of the firms it holds. The shares of these companies fluctuate when they pay dividends.\n\nIf your fund is underperforming the benchmark, it's mainly because it's not tracking the benchmark closely enough or is charging high fees. The notion that the underperformance you're seeing relates to the amount of dividends paid is a coincidence. An example Vanguard performance chart for an S&P500 index fund displays that if you add the S&P500 index benchmark to the plot, you can't differentiate between the two.

If you owned one share of Google prior to the split, you would have had one share providing you with X worth of equity in the company and 1 vote. After the split, you now have two shares which still give you the same X worth of equity and 1 vote, meaning there has been no change. Whether you choose to buy or sell depends on your individual valuation of the vote and how much you anticipate others will pay (or not) for that vote in the future. \n\nAs Google proceeds to issue new shares, it is likely that more of the newly issued shares will not have voting power, leading to dilution of equity but not of voting power. In most cases, our few votes hold little significance, so it is up to you to evaluate this situation as you see fit. \n\nGoogle's founders believe that they are better positioned to run the company for the long-term when there are fewer outside holders with shortsighted interests to consider. If you do not agree with this strategy, or if you are only interested in short-term gains, then becoming a shareholder of Google is likely not a sound decision. As always, carefully evaluate the facts for yourself, taking into account your personal situation and beliefs."}
{"3911": "\n\nI have been in a similar position as you, and I understand that dealing with credit bureaus can be difficult, especially when large sums of money are involved. To make a long story short, someone opened a store credit card under my name and charged around $3,000. When I reported this to the bureaus, they refused to remove the fraudulent account from my credit report, claiming that it was a \"frivolous\" claim. However, after filing a police report and contacting the fraud department of the store credit card, they investigated and eventually removed the account from my credit.\n\nI recommend taking the following steps: First, communicate with your creditors and debt collectors to stop them from reporting any fraudulent accounts. After providing them with a valid identity theft report, they cannot report any fraudulent accounts to the credit reporting companies. Additionally, request copies of documents related to the theft of your identity, such as transaction records or applications for new accounts. To obtain these documents, write to the company holding them and provide a copy of your identity theft report. You can also specify that the company should give the documents to a certain law enforcement agency.\n\nFurthermore, you can stop a debt collector from contacting you by sending them a letter to cease communication. They are usually required to comply with this request. Lastly, ask a debt collector to provide you with written information about the debt, such as the name of the creditor and the amount you owe.\n\nWhile you stated that your main issue was the combination of your credit account with another, there is a possibility that identity theft was involved. If this is the case and you can prove it, you will have access to more tools to help you. For instance, you can file a report with the FTC and use this, along with a police report, to combat these charges. For more information, visit the identitytheft.gov website."}
{"3912": "Do you mean \"condo\" when you say \"apartment\" since you're discussing buying? While a condo is generally cheaper to purchase than a house of an equivalent size and condition, you will need to pay condo fees indefinitely. This means you pay less upfront, but there is an ongoing expense. With a condo, the condo association generally manages external maintenance, so it's not your responsibility. Nevertheless, you should determine precisely what you are responsible for and what they are. You typically won't have to worry much about maintaining the parking areas, mowing grass, or taking care of roofing or outside walls. You are paying for all of these facilities through your condo fees. Short-term loans have two benefits: First, you owe less money if you pay it back faster, so the overall cash value for each percentage point of interest is less. Second, with a shorter-term loan, you may usually get a lower interest rate because the bank has less concern about interest rates for a 15-year term than for a 30-year term. So if you intend to sell the property and pay off the loan in ten years, you will most likely save money with a 15-year loan due to the lower interest rate. However, monthly payments are typically higher with shorter-term loans. Any advantages will be nullified if you cannot afford the monthly payments. If you have less than a 20% down payment, you would usually have to pay mortgage insurance. Saving 20% is a wise idea because it saves you a lot of money. Every extra dollar of down payment would reduce the interest amount you have to pay. You should keep an emergency fund and not put all your spare cash into a down payment if you can avoid it, but you should try to make the biggest possible down payment. (Although some individuals may argue that it's preferable to invest spare cash in the stock market or another investment rather than paying off a mortgage, that's a separate issue.) I'm not sure what you're implying with \"I do not think it's a good idea to make any principal payments because I would probably lose them when I want to sell the house and pay off the mortgage.\" When you sell the house, you will get back any additional principal payments you made. As an instance, when you buy a house for $100,000 and pay $30,000 in principal over time (including regular and additional payments), and then sell it for $120,000. You'll have to pay the remaining $70,000 balance on the loan out of the $120,000, which will leave $50,000 to pay other costs, and the remainder will go into your pocket. In situation two, you buy a house for $100,000, pay $40,000 in principal, and sell it for $120,000. You would subtract $60,000 from the $120,000, leaving $60,000. You've added an extra $10,000, but you'll get it back when you sell. You'll get back any additional principal you put in, whether you make or lose money on the property, in terms of lower payments for the remaining principal on the mortgage when you sell."}

{"3917": "\n\nTrading CFDs usually incurs lower fees than standard share trading. While there is typically no joining fee to register with a broker, you must fund your account with the required minimum to start trading. However, note that CFD trading may not be allowed in the USA. There are no margin fees associated with trading CFDs, but you need to provide the initial margin amount to purchase or sell a CFD. For instance, if you want to buy 1000 units of a share CFD with a $10 underlying price and the CFD provider has a 10% margin, your initial margin is $1000. If the share price rises to $11, you will earn $1000 on the CFD trade or $1000 profit if you sold the shares. However, if the share price drops to $9, you will lose $1000 on the CFD trade, or $1000 if you sold the shares. The CFD brokerage fees are usually lower than share trading, and overnight financing costs apply for every long position you hold overnight. Note that you are not charged financing costs for short positions but may receive financing for holding short positions if interest rates are high. If you lack sufficient funds to open the size of trade you want, your bitcoin position may be closed out. If you're not ready to trade CFDs, you should learn more about them and the trading platform before investing your funds. You could open a simulation account to get familiar with the trading platform and CFDs. In case of confusion, ask your broker since they usually have training videos and seminars."}

I assume you are interested in purchasing property in mainland China rather than Hong Kong or any other location. The feasibility of this decision depends on several factors such as which city, district, community, and school district you are interested in, as well as the age of the building. It is important to note that when you buy a flat in mainland China, you do not own the land but rather rent it from the state. While some may argue that the real property market in China is constantly in a bubble, various factors unique to China, such as the one-child policy, make it difficult to make such claims.

The longer the term, the higher the term premium. \n\nCorporate bonds also have a default premium, which compensates the holder for the risk of default or a decrease in company prospects. Both government and corporate bonds are affected by changes in the fed funds rate, as new bonds become more attractive. \n\nIf the fed funds rate unexpectedly rises, holding a bond may result in a loss, especially for long-term bonds. However, if the increase was expected, it would already be priced in, making it hard to predict future rate changes. \n\nWhile treasuries are tax-advantaged and have a convenience yield, they pay relatively little.
